We used motion-triggered video cameras deployed at deer carcasses to determine how pumas and black bears affected three aspects of carrion acquisition by scavengers: presence, total feeding time, and mean feeding-bout duration. We found that pumas were unable to limit acquisition of carrion by large carnivores but did limit aspects of carrion acquisition by both birds and mesocarnivores. Through their suppression of mesocarnivores and birds, pumas apparently initiated a cascading pattern and increased carrion acquisition by small carnivores. In contrast, black bears monopolized carrion resources and generally had larger limiting effects on carrion acquisition by all scavengers. Black bears also limited puma feeding behaviors at puma kills, which may require pumas to compensate for energetic losses through increasing their kill rates of ungulates. Our results suggest that pumas provide carrion and selectively influence species acquiring carrion, while black bears limit carrion availability to all other scavengers. These results suggest that the effects of large carnivores on scavengers depend on attributes of both carnivores and scavengers (including size) and that competition for carcasses may result in intraguild predation as well as mesocarnivore release.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,10.1086/681004,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/681004,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/suppl/10.1086/681004,none,english,no,expert curated,UGA Library,0,society,journal article,2015,https://paperpile.com/app/p/ca8bbc8a-257d-0bd1-b8df-99f5161c4602,not needed,maxallen@illinois.edu,Allen ML,"School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington",Elbroch LM,"Panthera, New York",Wilmers CC,"Center for Integrated Spatial Research, Environmental Studies Department, Unviersity of California, Santa Cruz",Wittmer HU,"School of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington",none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,no photo in manuscript,

Ecological theory predicts the trait that determines the resource holding potential (RHP), and hence the winner of encounter competition, is most often body size or mass. The difficulties of observing encounter competition in complex organisms in natural environments, however, has limited opportunities to test this theory across diverse species. We studied the outcome of encounter competition contests among mesocarnivores at deer carcasses in California to determine the most important variables for winning these contests. We found some support for current theory in that body mass is important in determining the winner of encounter competition, but we found that other factors including hunger and species-specific traits were also important. In particular, our top models were “strength and hunger” and “size and hunger,” with models emphasizing the complexity of variables influencing outcomes of encounter competition. In addition, our wins above predicted (WAP) statistic suggests that an important aspect that determines the winner of encounter competition is species-specific advantages that increase their RHP, as bobcats (Lynx rufus) and spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) won more often than predicted based on mass. In complex organisms, such as mesocarnivores, species-specific adaptations, including strategic behaviors, aggressiveness, and weapons, contribute to competitive advantages and may allow certain species to take control or defend resources better than others.

To determine how thinning affects predator occurrence, we assessed relationships between predator occupancy and the density of small mammals (prey) across a range of tree stocking levels (basal area of 10–65 m2/ha). Predators were detected using 2 techniques: baited track plates and motion-sensitive cameras. We sampled 33 sites for 2 weeks each in order to detect presence of predators, and estimated occupancy using occupancy models and multimodel inference. We modeled occupancy rates for gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyote (Canis latrans), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Our results suggest that thinning may have a positive influence on gray fox and coyote abundance, but a negative influence on raccoon abundance. However, our inability to develop strong models that predicted predator occupancy indicates that higher sample sizes and more habitat covariates are needed. Our simulations indicated that, given our occupancy and detection rates, a sample size of 75 sites would allow us to better model occupancy covariates. Overall, we found that predator occupancy can be assessed at large spatial scales using occupancy approaches, particularly using motion-sensitive cameras, which were the most time- and cost-efficient of the methods we analyzed.

Su frecuencia de ocurrencia se agrupó en 81.6% plantas, principalmente frutos, 68 0% artrópodos, 31.7% mamíferos, 18 6% reptiles, 4.6% aves y 2.0% peces; un 4.2% fue material no comestible y sin identificación Se presentaron diferencias en la abundancia de consumo (frecuencia y volumen relativo) principalmente de tipo temporal, dividido en secas-1 (SC3), lluvias y secas-2 (SC2) La mayor abundancia de consumo fue de frutos y artrópodos incrementándose a partir de lluvias; el principal consumo de vertebrados se presentó en SCI, con un aumento posterior en SC2, El promedio de presas por excreta fue de 3 a 4, y representó de 12 a 84 g en biomasa animal promedio constituida generalmente por- artrópodos, un vertebrado pequeño, una porción de carroña equivalente, o la combinación de estos, aunado a un consumo importante de ñutos, como Ficus palmen durante todo el año y otros como Karwinskia humboldtiana y Pachycereuspringlei en SCI y Bourreria sonorae, Síenocereus gummosus, Randia megacarpa, Gástela penimularis y Phoradendron díguetianum en SC2. Por1 el uso que hace del recurso, los índices estandarizados de Shannon-Weiner (Js ) y Levins (B1 e), lo determinaron principalmente como especialista hacia el empleo de ñutos y artrópodos a través de la frecuencia de presas (B'e= 0.23) y el volumen (P= 0 18 y B\~ 0 35), Fue generalista para presas de tipo vertebrado. El consumo de frutos se relacionó a su patrón fenoíógico, las bayas de cactáceas y otras presentaron una floración sincrónica en tiempo de secas; en contraste, las drupas de arbustos y síconos de F palmeti ocurrieron por una floración asincrónica todo el año, incrementándose los individuos en fructificación a partir de la temporada de lluvias.. El tamaño (cobertura y altura) y densidad de las plantas fueron medidas indirectas en la producción de frutos y su uso. Por ejemplo, un sólo árbol de F palmen con 9.23% de importancia, lo situaron por arriba de varios arbustos y herbáceas, cuya importancia en la comunidad fue determinada generalmente por su densidad.. La abundancia de vertebrados no se relacionó al consumo que de ellas hizo el babisuri el cual fue menor (1= -0 88, p< 0 05), aunque se presentaron algunos valores positivos para los roedores Peromyscus eremicus, Neotoma lepida y la lagartija Scelopotus spp.. con una tendencia positiva (¡= 0 68, p< 0.05); para artrópodos se determinó una tendencia de correlación en SCI {r^ 0.47, p< 0.05) de manera general, y específica para Tcnebrionidae (i- 0.50, p< 0.05) y Scarabeidae (i~ 0 94, p< 0 05) Este consumo se propone como una conducta oportunista asociado al tipo de movimientos y habitat común a sus presas, pero también a una preferencia de presas pequeñas como son alacranes, arácnidos, coleópteros y ortópteros, abundantes en ambientes áridos, y cuya diversidad aumenta, así como el de su consumo en temporadas favorables de lluvias También se presentó un forrajeo hacia la zona de playa, a partir del varamiento de peces y de alimento procesado obtenido de visitantes y pescadores en SCl, cuando ocurrió la menor variedad de alimento autóctono.",Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,none,https://repositorio.unam.mx/contenidos/299123,none,none,spanish,yes,expert curated,University Library,0,collegiate research,thesis,2002,https://paperpile.com/app/p/8a3bddc1-322a-0e6b-a1bf-3f5d55ba19e6,not needed,not provided,Calderón Vega J,Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,"124 latrines included in count.

Este tipo de trabajos evidencian una serie de relaciones ecológicas que de otra forma serían imperceptibles y que son de vital importancia para el manejo y utilización de las poblaciones naturales. El cacomixtle es un carnívoro perteneciente a la Familia Procyonidae, cuya distribución es exclusiva del continente americanoyen nuestro país existen pocos trabajos acerca de sus hábitos alimentarios. En el presente trabajo se buscó profundizar en el conocimiento de la alimentación de Bassariscus astutus (cacomixtle) mediante el análisis de sus excretas en una zona de bosque templado (Arcos del Sitio, Tepotzotlán, Estado de México) y otra de matorral xerófilo (Tepeji del Río de Ocampo, Hidalgo). Se recolectaron un total de 67 excretas durante muestreos mensuales de febrero a septiembre de 2007, en senderos, veredas, lugares con abundantes rocas y cercanos a cuerpos de agua. Los componentes de las excretas fueron separados y se determinaron y con su peso correspondiente se obtuvo el Valor de Importancia Alimentaria (V.I.A). El número de elementos que conformaron la dieta del cacomixtle en ambas localidades fue amplio siendo mayor en Arcos del Sitio (32) que en Tepeji del Río (28). El espectro alimentario de Bassariscus astutus en el bosque templado y en el matorral xerófilo se conformó principalmente por: vegetales, artrópodos y mamíferos. Los elementos más importantes en la dieta del cacomixtle en Arcos del Sitio fueron los frutos del nopal Opuntia streptacantha y O. megacantha, los escarabajos melolóntidos y los restos de alimentos desechados por el hombre, como papel aluminio y plástico. En Tepeji del Río fueron los frutos de Myrtillocactus geometrizans, la rata Sigmodon hispidus y los escarabajos de la familia Melolonthidae. También existió un consumo diferencial entre épocas dentro de cada localidad.

A potentially novel haemotropic Mycoplasma sp. has been previously detected in the ring-tailed coatis from central-western and southern Brazil. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence of haemotropic Mycoplasma sp. and tick-borne pathogens in wild ring-tailed coatis from the INP, Foz do Iguaçu municipality, Paraná State, southern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 18 wild ring-tailed coatis and evaluated by conventional PCR (cPCR) assays for haemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (16S and 23S rRNA), Theileria/Babesia spp. (18S rRNA) and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. (16S rRNA, sodB, dsb and groEL). Eight out of 18 (44.44%; 95% CI: 24.56%-66.28%) animals were positive for haemotropic Mycoplasma spp. All ring-tailed coatis tested negative for Theileria/Babesia spp. and only one out of 18 (5.56%; 95% CI: 0.99%-25.76%) animals tested positive for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. by the 16S rRNA cPCR. Unfortunately, multiple attempts to sequence the 16S rRNA gene of the Ehrlichia/Anaplasma-positive sample have failed. Phylogenetic and network analysis of the hemoplasma 16S and 23S rRNA gene fragments confirmed that animals were infected by a potentially novel haemotropic Mycoplasma sp. previously reported in ring-tailed coatis from Brazil.

We video-monitored 115 nests and documented 39 predation events by at least 9 predator species. Overall, we observed avian species (51%, n = 39), specifically brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater; n = 12), and snakes (26%, n = 39) as the most frequent nest predators. The estimated daily nest survival rate during the laying and incubation stage was 0.985 (95% CI = 0.967–0.993) and 0.944 (95% CI = 0.921–0.961) during the nestling stage. In addition, we analyzed models of predator-specific nest predation using multinomial logistic regression. Effect of nest height on predation rate was significant for snakes; nest stage was significant for nests depredated by avian predators. By identifying and increasing our knowledge of nest predators and vegetation characteristics associated with greater risk of predation in multiple locations within the black-capped vireo's range, we can effectively manage habitat to benefit recovery efforts of the species.",WILEY,10.1002/jwmg.388,https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jwmg.388,none,0022-541X,english,yes,systematic search,UGA Library,0,society,journal article,2012,https://paperpile.com/app/p/b3c79c7f-2945-0088-be6b-95b819da49d2,not needed,,Conkling TJ,,Pope TL,,Smith KN,,Mathewson HA,,Morrison ML,,Wilkins RN,,Cain III JW,,none,none,none,none,none,none,GPS from one site with diet item detection from mulitsite study,

Comparisons between digestive strategies employed by arboreal herbivorous marsupials and primates inhabiting these forests reveal several trends: (i) foregut-fermenters occur only in tropical and sub-tropical forests, whereas caecum and caecum-colon fermenters occur in both temperate eucalypt and the tropical forests; (ii) the arboreal marsupials and primates (koalas, greater gliders, ringtail possums and sportive lemurs) that are the most folivorous are caecum or caecum-colon fermenters with colonic specializations for selective retention of small panicles of digesta; (iii) no caecum or caecum- colon fermenters lacking colonic separation mechanisms achieve consistently high degrees of folivory; (iv) even the most folivorous foregut-fermenting arboreal marsupials (tree kangaroos) or primates (colobus monkeys) include a substantial proportion of high-quality components (fruits or seeds) in their diet. Caecum or caecum-colon fermentation with colonic separation is postulated to be essential for a high degree of folivory in small mammals because it offsets potential limits on intake of high-fibre food and minimizes losses of faecal nitrogen that otherwise would be prohibitive. This digestive strategy is common among folivores in eucalypt forests because the low abundance of large seeds and fleshy fruits limits folivory-frugivory and folivory-granivory. Foregut fermentation employing a sacciform/ tubiform forestomach (as in tree kangaroos and colobus monkeys) is postulated to be optimal for mixed leaf/fruit and leaf/seed diets that are available in many tropical forests, assuming it allows high-fibre meals to be retained for microbial fermentation while permitting low-fibre meals to pass rapidly to the hindstomach for acid/enzymic digestion. However, foregut fermentation appears innappropriate for either primary frugivory or exclusive folivory due to the inefficiency of microbial digestion of simple sugars and constraints on microbial fermentation as a primary energy source for small mammals.",Blackwell Science Pty,10.1111/j.1442-9993.1996.tb00581.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1996.tb00581.x,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,1996,,,,Cork SJ,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,,,,,

Three plant secondary metabolites (PSMs): flavonoids, condensed tannins, and total phenols, exhibited seasonal changes in concentration; being lowest at June and gradually increasing from July to August/September. Total phenols was the only factor included in the best model of generalized linear models, indicating that total phenols was the most important factor deterring food selection by root voles. In contrast, tannins had a weak effect on food selection by root voles. This study indicated that PSMs play an important role in food selection by root voles; however, the effects of PSMs depend on the type of PSMs. Furthermore, this finding partly verifies the hypothesis that PSMs contribute to the defense strategy of plants, significantly influencing plant selection by root voles.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,,,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2014,,,,Dai X,,Han M,,Liu Q,,Shang G,,Yin B,,Wang A,,Dean BE,,Wei W,,Yang S,,,,,

During the winter of 1954–55 signs of ‘ringtail’ were noticed in many suckling rats. Generally, these symptoms were seen in 8-day-old young rats, the first signs being a marked scaliness of the tail and reddening of the tail tip (Fig. 1). In many cases the condition of the tail deteriorated, resulting in necrosis followed by its severance from the body. Microscopic examination of sections of the tails revealed in the early stages a marked hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis (Fig. 2). There was œdema (spongiosis) and hyperplasia of the prickle cell layer, resulting in acanthosis. In some of the specimens, the prickle cells at all levels contained large amounts of keratohyaline granules. The hair follicles were slightly dilated and were filled with keratinized invaginations of the cornified layers of the epidermis. The corium was œdematous and often congested with blood. In the more advanced lesions, there was extensive eosinophilic necrosis of both the epidermis and the corium, accompanied by leucocytic infiltration.

However, sparassodonts went extinct before most groups of carnivorans entered South America; only the endemic Cyonasua-group procyonids (Cyonasua and Chapalmalania), which immigrated to South America nearly 4 million years earlier than other carnivorans, significantly overlapped with sparassodonts in time. In this study, we examine the functional morphology of the dentition of Cyonasua and Chapalmalania through quantitative analysis to determine the dietary habits of these taxa and the degree to which they may have ecologically overlapped sparassodonts and large predatory Neogene didelphimorphians. We find Cyonasua and Chapalmalania to be more carnivorous than extant procyonids, other than Bassariscus, in agreement with previous studies, but more omnivorous than most other carnivorans and all meat-eating South American metatherians, including sparassodonts. The extreme ecological dissimilarity between Cyonasua-group procyonids and members of the endemic South American predator guild may explain why procyonids were able to successfully establish themselves in South America several million years earlier than most other northern mammals (including all other carnivorans): they moved into a previously unoccupied ecological niche (large omnivore) and avoided direct competition with incumbent native species, a situation similar to that documented in historical cases of biological invasion. The omnivorous diets and climbing/swimming abilities of procyonids may have increased their chances for a successful over-water dispersal relative to other carnivorans, further favoring their successful establishment in South America.",CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,10.1017/pab.2019.29,,,,english,yes,systematic search,Publisher Website,0,,journal article,2019,,,,Engelman RK,,Croft DA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigating the effects of anthropogenic pressures on sympatric carnivores is needed to improve our ability to develop targeted, effective management plans for carnivore conservation worldwide. Utilizing photographic, line-transect, and habitat sampling, as well as landscape analyses and village-based bushmeat hunting surveys, we provide the first investigation of how multiple forms of habitat degradation (fragmentation, exotic carnivores, human encroachment, and hunting) affect carnivore occupancy across Madagascar’s largest protected area: the Masoala-Makira landscape. We found that as degradation increased, native carnivore occupancy and encounter rates decreased while exotic carnivore occupancy and encounter rates increased. Feral cats (Felis species) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) had higher occupancy than half of the native carnivore species across Madagascar’s largest protected landscape. Bird and small mammal encounter rates were negatively associated with exotic carnivore occupancy, but positively associated with the occupancy of four native carnivore species. Spotted fanaloka (Fossa fossana) occupancy was constrained by the presence of exotic feral cats and exotic small Indian civet (Viverricula indica). Hunting was intense across the four study sites where hunting was studied, with the highest rates for the small Indian civet ( individuals consumed/year), the ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans) ( consumed/year), and the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) ( consumed/year). Our modeling results suggest hunters target intact forest where carnivore occupancy, abundance, and species richness, are highest.

However, basic information about its anatomy, which is essential for proper veterinary care, is poorly documented. Captive kinkajous often suffer from metabolic bone disorders resulting from inappropriate captive diet. Unfortunately, these bone diseases are difficult to diagnose due to a lack of understanding of baseline anatomy and available references, such as normal radiographs. There is also little understanding of kinkajou locomotion, which is important for understanding how they interact with their environment. The kinkajou can plantarflex and invert its pes (hindfoot) around multiple ankle and pes joints in order to fully reverse the pes 180°; however the myological and osteological adaptions that facilitate this behavior are unclear. Well-developed plantarflexor and invertor muscles were recently hypothesized in species exhibiting hindfoot reversal. However, recent studies of other procyonids do not support this hypothesis.To address the issue of the lack of understanding of basic kinkajou anatomy and its locomotor behaviors, the left and right hindlimbs of an adult male kinkajou were dissected. A detailed description, and documentation of the hindlimb muscles in P. flavus was conducted. Here, we present the first comprehensive review of the muscular anatomy of the hindlimb of P. flavus including detailed anatomical description, muscle maps of the pelvis, long bones, and pes, and comparisons to other documented species of the Carnivoran order.Our dissections revealed that the anatomy of the hindlimb muscles was generally consistent with previous descriptions of other carnivoran taxa, although we observed a few interesting differences. In the thigh, the kinkajou had three bellies of m. semimembranosus, in contrast to two bellies in another procyonid, the ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), giant panda, and the domestic dog. The only other taxa with three bellies were the lesser grison and red panda. In the quadriceps femoris group, the kinkajou most closely resembled the red panda; however, it also shared some similarities in the quadriceps femoris with the ringtail and lesser grison. In the leg, the kinkajou closely resembles the domestic dog and lesser grison in the morphology of the m. gastrocnemius. In m. popliteus, the kinkajou most closely resembles the ringtail.Having this baseline understanding of kinkajou hindlimb functional anatomy, can provide insight into adaptations for its unique locomotor style. This understanding also has implications for proper husbandry by lending itself to the development of more exceptional habitats and enrichments for captive specimens and creating awareness for how any potential changes to environmental habitat could affect their health and well-being.",WILEY,10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.615.3,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2019.33.1_supplement.615.3,,,english,yes,systematic search,Publisher Website,0,conference abstract,,2019,,,,Fields S,,Smith HF,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,

We hypothesized that the ring-tailed coati, Nasua nasua, uses an extensive acoustic repertoire that correlates to their diverse range of social interactions. We tested this hypothesis by observing and recording a free-ranging managed population of N. nasua in Tietê Ecological Park (PET), in the municipality of São Paulo, State of São Paulo, Brazil. Of 404 h of sampling, 47 h of coati vocalizations were recorded over 3 years. Additional records were obtained opportunistically on other free-living populations at PET by using passive acoustic monitoring. We describe here an acoustic repertoire composed of 15 calls (12 basic calls, 2 rhythmic calls and the non-random complex calls composed of three or four different units). This diverse repertoire of signals was used in contact/cohesion regulation, foraging activities, alert or potential threat situations, playing and fighting interactions and during social isolation and acute distress. The contact call (chirp) is produced through biphonation, and other non-linear phenomena are present.

However, because of its association with ciguatera fish poisoning, it is rarely fished for food. Previous research indicates that roi could have a negative impact on native reef fish assemblages because of their high densities and prey consumption rates. However, it is unclear whether roi add to the cumulative mortality of prey (predation hypothesis), or whether predation is instead compensatory (doomed surplus hypothesis). This study experimentally assessed the effects of roi on reef fish populations through a long-term (5.5 year) predator removal experiment. A Before-After-Control-Impact study design was used to assess changes in fish assemblages following the removal of roi on 1.3 ha of patch reef. Increases in the density of prey-sized fish (<15 cm TL) were observed 18 months after roi removal. However, those effects did not translate into sustained increases in prey. While increases in potential competitors, wrasses (family Labridae), particularly the piscivorous ringtail wrasse Oxycheilinus unifasciatus, were observed on roi-free reefs, the fish assemblage did not diverge substantially in composition. Native reef fish appeared to resist the potential negative impacts of predation by roi, possibly through a refuge in size for some fish families. Management to protect intact fish assemblage size-structure could serve to bolster native resistance to invading species. In considering the threats facing coral reefs, and the possible solutions, roi removal alone will not likely replenish native fishery resources.",SPRINGER,10.1007/s10641-017-0697-8,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10641-017-0697-8,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2018,,,,Giddens JL,,Wiggins C,,Friedlander AM,,Conklin EJ,,Stamoulis KA,,Minton D,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying the direct and indirect interactions among sympatric carnivores that enable their coexistence is particularly important to elucidate because they are integral for maintaining ecosystem function.We studied the effects of removing nine fishers (Pekania pennanti) on their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and ringtails (Bassariscus astutus). Grey foxes (family: Canidae) are likely to compete with fishers due to their similar body sizes and dietary overlap, and ringtails (family: Procyonidae), like fishers, are semi-arboreal species of conservation concern. We used spatial capture–recapture to investigate fisher population numbers and dynamic occupancy models that incorporated interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these species had on the colonization and persistence of each other's site occupancy.The fisher population showed no change in density for up to 3 years following the removals of fishers for translocations. In contrast, fisher site occupancy decreased in the years immediately following the translocations. During this same time period, site occupancy by grey foxes increased and remained elevated through the end of the study.We found a complicated hierarchy among fishers, foxes and ringtails. Fishers affected grey fox site persistence negatively but had a positive effect on their colonization. Foxes had a positive effect on ringtail site colonization. Thus, fishers were the dominant small carnivore where present and negatively affected foxes directly and ringtails indirectly.Coexistence among the small carnivores we studied appears to reflect dynamic spatial partitioning. Conservation and management efforts should investigate how intraguild interactions may influence the recolonization of carnivores to previously occupied landscapes.1 INTRODUCTION",WILEY,10.1111/1365-2656.12791,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.12791,,,english,yes,systematic search,Publisher Website,0,,journal article,2018,,,,Green DS,,Matthews SM,,Swiers RC,,Callas RL,,Scott Yaeger J,,Farber SL,,Schwartz MK,,Powell RA,,none,none,none,none,,

Average home-range sizes of ringtails (males 462 ha, females 94 ha, 95% fixed kernel) were among the largest reported to date. Females moved least in summer and most in autumn, but males showed no seasonal trend in movements. The average stay in a single den was 1.3 days. I found no effect of the closeness of approach of the den observer on the distance moved between successive dens. Ringtails used a variety of den settings: rocks, trees, shrubs, rocks and shrubs, and holes in the ground. Males used trees and rocks more and shrubs less than females. In summer and autumn, ringtails used rocks more and shrubs less than expected, and in winter ringtails used rocks less and shrubs and holes in the ground more than expected. There was no tendency to reuse certain types of dens, and 31.6% of dens were reoccupied at least once. Most ringtails died before the age of 4 due to predation, resulting in an annual survival rate of 0.375.

The mimicry complex was composed of a noxious model (Eleodes obscura (Say)) and a palatable mimic (Stenomorpha marginata (LeConte)). House crickets (Acheta domesticus) (Linn.) were used as alternative prey. The experiment was conducted for 23 nights in August and September to approximate the peak seasonal activity time period during which both models and mimics normally are exposed to predation while foraging and depositing eggs. Each night thirty prey in ratios of 16 models: 7 mimics: 7 crickets were exposed for 2.5 h to a suite of predators consisting of pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and ringtails (Bassariscus astutus) that had free access to the prey. The model-mimic ratio was similar to that found in nature. Predators obtained prey on 11 of the 23 nights and preferred the alternative prey (crickets) in proportions higher than was expected from a predation rate that was equal on all species of prey. Mimics were taken by predators at a rate proportional to their abundance, while models were taken at a rate considerably lower than their relative abundance. This suggests that at least some of the predators could distinguish between models and mimics and were willing to eat the mimics at higher frequencies than they were willing to eat the models. However, although the mimicry is not perfect with respect to the entire predator suite, the mimics still gain an advantage by resembling the models, compared to the predation levels on the alternate prey.",SPRINGER,10.1007/BF00397872,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00397872,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,1988,,,,Hetz M,,Slobodchikoff CN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk of predation, time spent engaging in antipredatory behavior, and feeding competition can all vary with respect to spatial position. Previous research has found evidence that feeding rates are higher at the group edge in many species, but these studies have not represented the entire breadth of dietary diversity and ecological situations faced by many animals. In particular, the presence of concentrated, defendable food patches can lead to increased feeding rates by dominants in the center of the group that are able to monopolize or defend these areas. To fully understand the tradeoffs of within‐group spatial position in relation to a variety of factors, it is important to be able to predict where individuals should preferably position themselves in relation to feeding rates and food competition. A qualitative model is presented here to predict how food depletion time, abundance of food patches within a group, and the presence of prior knowledge of feeding sites affect the payoffs of different within‐group spatial positions for dominant and subordinate animals. In general, when feeding on small abundant food items, individuals at the front edge of the group should have higher foraging success. When feeding on slowly depleted, rare food items, dominants will often have the highest feeding rates in the center of the group. Between these two extreme points of a continuum, an individual’s optimal spatial position is predicted to be influenced by an additional combination of factors, such as group size, group spread, satiation rates, and the presence of producer‐scrounger tactics.",UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,,,,,english,no,systematic search,Author Link,0,,journal article,2007,,,bthirsch@ic.sunysb.edu,Hirsch BT,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,

To understand how diet and ecology affect the social behavior of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua), detailed measures of feeding behavior were recorded from 2 well-studied groups over a 2-year period. The proportion of fruit and invertebrates in the diet of ring-tailed coatis in Iguazu, Argentina, was very similar to that in diets of white-nosed coatis (N. narica) and ring-tailed coatis studied at field sites in Brazil. Consumption of vertebrates in Iguazu was exceptionally rare. The proportion of time spent foraging for invertebrates and fruit generally matched seasonal changes in the abundance these foods in the environment. During the winter, when invertebrate and fruit availability was low, coatis spent a large amount of time feeding on 2 exotic fruit species. The presence of exotic fruits provided coatis with food during the lean winter season and may have influenced the high reproduction and survivorship found in this population. Coatis spent about 44% of their fruit-foraging time exploiting pindo palm (Syagrus romanzoffianum) fruits and it appeared that this fruit species played a major role in shaping the ranging and feeding behavior of coati groups. The time spent foraging at fruit trees and the total number of fruits eaten varied depending on the species of tree. Coati groups spent an average of 2.5–12.5 min feeding on different species of fruit trees, and coati groups ate an average of 2.6–269.8 fruits per tree species.

Two groups of habituated, individuallyrecognized, coatis were studied over a 2.5-yr period in Iguazu NationalPark, Argentina. Dominance matrices were divided by year and group,resulting in four dominance hierarchies which were analyzed using theMatman computer program. Strong general patterns were seen in bothgroups during both years. Adult males (one per group) were the highestranking individuals, followed by male juveniles, female juveniles, adultfemales, and male and female subadults. The pattern in which young,physically inferior individuals were able to outrank larger adults is different from other social mammal species in that the juvenile coatisaggressively defended food resources and directed aggression towardsolder individuals. These agonistic interactions may not reflect ‘dominance’ in the traditional sense, and appear to be a form of ‘toleratedaggression.’ This tolerated aggression leads to increased access to food,and should help juveniles during a period in which they need to rapidlygain weight and grow. Because this tolerance of juvenile aggression isreinforced through coalitionary support of juveniles by adult females,agonistic patterns are also consistent with the hypothesis that juvenilerank is being influenced by high degrees of relatedness within coatigroups.

When groups feed at large clumped resources, dominant individuals can often monopolize the resource, leading to higher feeding success in the center of the group. In order to test these predictions, behavioral data relating foraging success to within-group spatial position were recorded from two habituated groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) in Iguazu, Argentina. Foraging success did not fit expected patterns. When feeding on small ground litter invertebrates, coatis had the same foraging success at all spatial positions. This pattern likely resulted from an abundance of invertebrates in the ground litter. When feeding on fruit, individuals in the front of the group had greater feeding success, which was driven by the relatively quick depletion of fruit trees. Dominant juveniles were often located in the front of the group which led to increased access to food. This resulted in higher feeding success on fruits but simultaneously increased their risk of predation. Although groups typically became more elongated and traveled faster when feeding on fruit, it did not appear that the coatis were drastically changing their spacing strategies when switching between the two food types. Paradoxically, spatial position preferences during invertebrate foraging appeared to be driven by fruit trees. Because fruit trees were encountered so frequently, juveniles ranging at the front edge of the group during invertebrate foraging were the first to arrive at fruit trees and thus had higher foraging success. This study demonstrates the importance of how food patch size and depletion rate affect the spatial preferences of individuals.",SPRINGER,10.1007/s00265-010-1058-1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-010-1058-1,,,english,no,systematic search,Author Link,0,,journal article,2011,,,bthirsch@ic.sunysb.edu,Hirsch BT,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,

Although some studies have investigated the factors which affect visual food detection, very little is known about what influences olfactory food detection abilities in wild animals. The food discovery behavior of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) was studied using experimental fruit plots. Coatis primarily used olfaction to detect these new food sources, and visual food discovery appeared plausible in only five of 148 trials. Coatis detected the fruit from longer distances when traveling compared with when foraging for invertebrates in the leaf litter. Travel speed had a negative effect on discovery distance. Coatis traveling slowly detected the fruit plots from further away, which demonstrated a tradeoff between speed and food detection. If this tradeoff is biologically important, slower groups should have visited more fruit trees per day, so data taken during full-day coati group follows were analyzed to determine whether this pattern occurred. Slower moving groups visited more fruit trees than faster groups once confounding factors such as daily travel distance, group identity, group spread, and year were controlled for. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that coatis exhibit a speed-accuracy tradeoff for olfactory food detection. This tradeoff appears to be an important factor influencing the movement ecology of animal groups.",WILEY,10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01783.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01783.x,,,english,no,systematic search,Author Link,0,,journal article,2010,,,hirschb@si.edu,Hirsch BT,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,

For terrestrial social animals, predation, feeding success, and social competition are thought to be three of the most important variables. The relative importance of these three factors was investigated in groups of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) in Iguazú, Argentina. Different age/sex classes responded differently to these three variables. Coatis were found in close proximity to their own age/sex class more often than random, and three out of four age/sex classes were found to exhibit within-group spatial position preferences which differed from random. Juveniles were located more often at the front edge and were rarely found at the back of the group. Juveniles appeared to choose spatial locations based on feeding success and not predation avoidance. Since juveniles are the most susceptible to predation and presumably have less prior knowledge of food source location, these results have important implications in relation to predator-sensitive foraging and models of democratic group leadership. Subadults were subordinate to adult females, and their relationships were characterized by high levels of aggression. This aggression was especially common during the first half of the coati year (Nov–April), and subadults were more peripheralized during this time period. Subadults likely chose spatial positions to avoid aggression and were actively excluded from the center of the group by adult females. In the Iguazú coati groups, it appeared that food acquisition and social agonism were the major determinants driving spatial choice, while predation played little or no role. This paper demonstrates that within-group spatial structure can be a complex process shaped by differences in body size and nutritional requirements, food patch size and depletion rate, and social dominance status. How and why these factors interact is important to understanding the costs and benefits of sociality and emergent properties of animal group formation.",SPRINGER,10.1007/s00265-010-1056-3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-010-1056-3,,,english,no,systematic search,Author Link,0,,journal article,2011,,,hirschb@si.edu,Hirsch BT,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,

Ecologists often use mechanistic animalmovement models to understand these links, but animal movement models rarely connect empiricallywith an understanding of how animals actually decide to move around in their environment. To betterunderstand this relationship, we compared the travel behaviour of two sympatric mammal species thathave broadly similar diets: brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella nigritus, and ring-tailed coatis, Nasuanasua. According to most mechanistic animal movement models, species that exploit the same resourcesshould show similar movement patterns. Although the fruit component of coati and capuchin diets isvery similar, coatis primarily feed on invertebrates in the leaf litter or soil, while capuchins forage oninvertebrate prey in the forest canopy. We found that these two species showed markedly differentmovement patterns: while capuchins typically travelled between fruit trees in relatively straight lines,coatis had significantly more tortuous daily travel paths and frequently visited the same fruit trees morethan once per day. These circular coati travel paths would not be predicted by most foraging models. Weposit that these differences in coati and capuchin movement patterns are driven by differences inarboreal and terrestrial travel costs, exploitation of fallen fruits and shifts in foraging behaviour over thecourse of the day. Because these seemingly small differences between the two species lead to majordifferences in movement behaviour, we posit that animal movement models need to better incorporate(1) travel costs, (2) both directed travel and random food search and (3) realistic diet models that includeresources with different nutrient compositions",ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000334721300242X,,,french,no,systematic search,Author Link,0,,journal article,2013,,not-needed,hirschb@si.edu,Hirsch BT,,Tujague MP,,Blanco YE,,Bitetti MS,,Janson CH,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proportion of food eaten before the arrival of conspecifics, the finder’s share, is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping group geometry, foraging strategy, and feeding competition. The variables that affect the finder’s share in ring-tailed coatis were tested using a series of food trials. The number of grapes in the food trials had a strong negative effect on the finder’s share and the probability that the finder was joined. The effect of group size on the finder’s share and foraging success was not straightforward and was mediated by sociospatial factors. The finder’s share increased when the time to arrival of the next individual was longer, the group was more spread out, and the finder was in the back of the group. Similarly, the total amount of food eaten at a trial was higher when more grapes were placed, arrival time was longer, and the number of joiners was smaller. Individuals at the front edge of the group found far more food trials, but foraging success was higher at the back of the group where there were fewer conspecifics to join them.

Populations living in the presence of the ring-tailed pike cichlid (Crenicichlasaxatilis) are smaller, mature earlier, allocate more energy to offspring and get more and smaller young than guppies in localities without Crenicichla. We investigated if Crenicichlasaxatilis is a size-selective predator, if the selectivity is a result of active choice and if the optimal prey size can be explained according to an optimal foraging model. In single-prey experiments we quantified the predators’ pre-capture costs (time), capture success, and post-capture costs (time) for four different prey sizes spanning from 10 to 40 mm total length. To see which of the components of the prey cycle the predator takes into account for its choice, we then predicted prey values and optimal prey size with 6 different models that included one or more of the prey cycle components.In two multiple prey experiments, the cichlids were given the choice of the two and four different prey sizes simultaneously. Crenicichlasaxatilis actively selected the largest guppies in both cases. The three prey-value functions that included handling time (post-capture cost) did not accurately predict the prey choice. Instead the prey-value functions that took into account pre-capture cost (approach and attack time) were able to correctly predict the choice of the largest guppy size, suggesting that pre-capture costs may be more important than post-capture costs for prey choice in Crenicichlasaxatilis. The study confirms that Crenicichlasaxatilis is a size-selective predator selecting large guppies, while earlier evidence for selectivity for large prey in Crenicichla cichlids has been weak and equivocal. Our result strengthen the possibility that size-selective predation is a mechanism in life-history evolution in guppies.",WILEY,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12938.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12938.x,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2004,,,,Johansson J,,Turesson H,,Persson A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Season of capture played an important role in the total number and species of cestodes isolated from the hosts, with the winter season having significantly lower counts than summer. Mesocestoides sp. was most abundant in spring and winter, whereas A. procyonis was most abundant in summer, although mixed infections were apparent. Host weight and sex played no significant role in the number or species of cestodes found. Host age class played no significant role in total cestode or in A. procyonis counts but was marginally significant regarding Mesocestoides sp. counts.

A ringtail mother with three kits was observed around a den in the attic of an occupied home at the base of Sugar Loaf from July through October of 1976. Ringtails used a regular route through the douglas fir forest, one arriving between 9:35 and 9:45 regularly. A parent and kit visited the forest bait station on four consecutive nights, three of the nights arriving within ten minutes of 11:30. The lone ringtail foraged with nose to the ground and tail stretched out behind. The parent and kit walked more leisurely; climbed trees and played around the bait station. Gray foxes began visiting the bait station after one week and a lone ringtail arrived before and sometimes after the fox visits. At the den in the attic, the mother and three kits confined their activites to the area immediately surrounding the house for approximately the first month after they moved in (during the time the kits were from eight to twelve weeks old). After this time the kits and mother appeared to come and go from the den somewhat independently of each other though they were often together. The mother appeared more cautious, nervous, and wary than the kits. While they played, she remained alert. In play the kits were in contact with each other or the mother for about 20% of the time. They played by running, leaping, and diving on each other. The kits were less coordinated than the mother for at least five months. They often fell and lost their balance while she could leap effortlessly over them to avoid collisions. The kits appeared to find food by following their mother to a food source and imitating her, or by exploring, playing with, and stumbling upon food. The black and white rings of the ringtail tail as well as the grayish body are excellent camouflage in open spaces at twilight because of the dark and light gray contrasts in the forest. This is equally true in the moonlight. The mother ringtail barked at, but did not attack, a raccoon who was between her and her kits in the den. At another time she did attack a female ringtail in the same position as the raccoon had been. At least one ringtail was allowed to come and go from the den without hostility from the parents or kits. Other ringtails visited the den area --but not the den-- to take food. The vocalizations of adult ringtails were a low grunt bark at the raccoon between the mother and her kits in the den; a high wheee sound when the mother attacked a ringtail in the same position as the raccoon had been; and a sharp, high pitched bark in the forest. Types of ringtail locomotion noted were a low crouched walk; a relaxed higher walk; leaping up vertical surfaces; leaping horizonatlly from rock to rock; a running gallop in play; fast running in attack; an alert, stealthy, aggressive crouched walk while approaching to attack. Postures observed were an alert stance with nose lifted upward, body lifted up slighly with neck stretched long and ear twitchin and scanning; a focused posture with whole body rigid and pointing in one direction; crouched posture on a tree limb, tail wrapped around the body; standing up, resting on back legs with front paws held up, balancing and nose pointed upward; payful snap with the mouth.

For >1 mo in the laboratory, woodrats from both populations were fed rabbit chow with increasing amounts of phenolic resin extracted from creosote bush until they lost body mass or showed any sign of sickness. Woodrats from the Mojave population maintained body mass at higher concentrations of resin and remained in the experiment longer. There were no differences between populations in food intake across all resin levels; however, maximum resin intake was 25% higher for the Mojave population. Food intake decreased with increasing resin intake. Glucuronic acid excretion in urine, one indicator of detoxification capacity, did not differ between populations. Water consumption increased with increased levels of creosote resin in the diet in woodrats from both populations. The results are consistent with the idea of differential tolerance to creosote bush phenolic resin in desert woodrat populations. Woodrats appear to be a promising natural system to study the developmental or genetic factors underlying vertebrate adaptation to plant secondary metabolites.",WILEY,10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2067:IDITTC]2.0.CO;2,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2067:IDITTC]2.0.CO;2,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2000,,,,Mangione AM,,Dearing MD,,Karasov WH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methodology consisted of ethnobiological techniques and participative planning. A total of 120 interviews were applied, and seven orders, 12 families, and 18 mammal species were reported. Local experts assigned six categories of use to the species: 61% as food, 44.4% as ornamental, 16.6% as pets, and 11.1% as for handcraft and mystical-religious purposes. Sixteen percent of species are traded as pets or in butcheries in local markets. Based on reported frequencies, the most important species for local communities are the white tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), armadillo (Dayspus novemcinctus), and wild rabbit (Sylvilagus cunicularius). Eleven species of mammals are edible, indicating that they are an important protein resource for the COBIO people. Half of the species were included in more than one category of use, being denominated multiple use species; an example is the white tail deer. Some species (61.1%) were reported as harmful for crops and domestic animals, including the coati (Nasua narica), raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), and cacomixtle (Bassariscus astutus).

This condition was first noted after the rats had been on the depletion diet for a period of 5 to 6 weeks and it developed in about 10 out of 100 animals used during the depletion period of approximately 7 weeks.The basal diets used had the following composition:In the first assay, using diet A. factor II was supplied by feeding 0.5 cc daily of a liver filtrate concentrate prepared from Lilly Liver Extract Powder 343 by 5 treatments with fuller's earth after the method of Lepkovsky, Jukes and Krause. The filtrate secured by this procedure was further treated with 8 volumes of 95% ethanol and the resulting precipitate was discarded. The final filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to the point where 1 cc represented 2 g of the original liver extract powder. In the second assay using diet B a filtrate was used which had been prepared from Armour's Liver Extract 70 A.S. by similar treatment. This preparation was fed at a level of 0.2 cc daily since preliminary experiments showed that this amount supplied sufficient factor II to satisfy the growth requirement of the rat.Basal diet B contained 4% hydrogenated cottonseed oil and 4% lard. This change was made to avoid the possibility of a deficiency of unsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Since no difference was noted in the response of the rats in the two assays it is believed that both diets were equally satisfactory.",WILEY,10.3181/00379727-45-11811,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3181/00379727-45-11811p,none,,english,no,systematic search,UGA LIbrary,ILL,,journal article,1940,,,,McElroy LW,,Goss H,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated variation in the foliar concentrations of five constituents: total phenolics (TP); the foliar component bound by polyethylene glycol (PEGBC); the formylphloroglucinol compound, sideroxylonal (a strong deterrent of mammalian herbivory); the terpene, cineole; and nitrogen (N). These constituents were analyzed using near infrared spectroscopy in 501 individual tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys) trees at 42 sites across a broad geographic range in eastern Australia. We tested three hypotheses: (1) trees with lower foliar N produce higher PSM concentrations; (2) PSM concentrations are greater at colder sites; and (3) PSM concentrations are higher at sites with low resource availability. Hypothesis 1 was true for all PSMs considered and was the result of variation that occurred within sites. This is consistent with the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis and with the hypothesis that PSMs protect leaves from photodamage. Hypothesis 2 was upheld for all constituents. This was consistent with both the growth–differentiation balance hypothesis, and with the hypothesis that PSMs represent an evolutionary adaptation to greater risks of photodamage and frost damage in cold environments. Hypothesis 3 was rejected, with one PSM, sideroxylonal, being affected by resource availability in a manner opposite to that predicted. The optimal defense hypothesis offers an explanation for this result (as sideroxylonal concentrations increased along with the apparent nutritional quality of the foliage, possibly to provide defense against higher rates of herbivory). We found that trees associated with koala fecal pellets had lower concentrations of sideroxylonal and cineole. We discuss this finding and further implications for the herbivores of Eucalyptus of the patterns of plant defense that we detected.",WILEY,10.1890/03-4038,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/03-4038,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2004,,,,"Moore BD,Wallis IR,Wood JT,Foley WJ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that most contemporary procyonids have remained in tropic andsubtropic climates because they have retained the metabolic characteristics of theirwarm-adapted ancestors, whereas Procyon lotor evolved a different set of adaptations that haveenabled it to generalize its use of habitats and climates. To test this hypothesis we comparedProcyon lotor with several other procyonids (Bassariscus astutus, Nasua nasua, Nasua narica,Procyon cancrivorus, and Potos flavus) with respect to (1) basal metabolic rate (Hb), (2)minimum wet thermal conductance (Cmw), (3) diversity of diet (Dd), (4) intrinsic rate of naturalincrease (r ), and, where possible, (5) capacity for evaporative cooling (Ec). We measuredbasal and thermoregulatory metabolism, evaporative water loss, and body temperature of bothsexes of Procyon lotor from north central Virginia, in summer and winter. Metabolic data forother procyonids were from literature, as were dietary and reproductive data for all species.Procyon lotor differed from other procyonids in all five variables. (1) Procyon lotor'& massspecific Hb (0.46 mL Ojg'h' 1) was 1.45 to 1.86 times greater than values for other procyonids.(2) Because of its annual molt, Procyon lotor's Cmw was about 49% higher in summer thanwinter, 0.0256 and 0.0172 mL O2 g ""1hl oCI, respectively. The ratio of measured to predictedCmw for Procyon lotor in winter (1.15) was similar to values calculated for Potos flavus (1.02)and Procyon cancrivorus (1.25). Values for other procyonids were higher than this, but less thanthe value for Procyon lotor (1.76) in summer. On a mass specific basis, Bassariscus astutus hadthe lowest Cmw with a ratio of 0.85. (3) Procyon lotor utilized three times as many foodcategories as Procyon cancrivorus, Nasua nasua, and Bassariscus astutus; about two times asmany as Nasua narica; and nine times as many as Potos flavus. (4) Intrinsic rate of naturalincrease correlated positively with Hb. Procyon lotor had the highest r ^ (2.52 of expected) andPotos flavus the lowest (0.48 of expected). The other procyonids examined also had low Hb, buttheir rmax's were higher than predicted (1.11-1.32 of expected). Early age of first femalereproduction, fairly large litter size, long life span, high-quality diet, and, in one case, femalesocial organization all compensated for low Hb and elevated rmax. (5) Although data on thecapacity for evaporative cooling were incomplete, this variable appeared to be best developed inProcyon lotor and Bassariscus astutus, the two species that have been most successful atincluding temperate climates in their distributions.These five variables are functionally interrelated, and have co-evolved in each species to forma unique adaptive unit that regulates body temperature and energy balance throughout eachannual cycle. The first four variables were converted into normalized dimensionless numbers,which were used to derive a composite score that represented each species' adaptive unit.Procyon lotor had the highest composite score (1.47) and Potos flavus the lowest (0.39). Scoresfor the other procyonids were intermediate to these extremes (0.64-0.79). There was a positivecorrelation between the number of climates a species occupies and the magnitude of itscomposite score. Linear regression of this relationship indicated that 89% of the variance inclimatic distribution was attributed to the composite scores. Differences in metabolic adaptation,therefore, have played a role in delimiting climatic distribution of these species.It was clear that Procyon lotor differed from the other procyonids with respect tothermoregulatory ability, diet, and reproductive potential. These differences have enabled it tobecome a highly successful climate generalise and its evolution of an Hb that is higher than theprocyonid norm appears to be the cornerstone of its success.",SMITHSONIAN INST PRESS,10.5479/si.00810282.542,https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/5326,,,english,yes,systematic search,Publisher Website,0,,journal article,1993,,,,Mugaas JN,,Seidensticker J,,Mahlke-Johnson KP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desde un enfoque conservacionista estos estudios son usados como herramientas clave para proponer programas de manejo, protección, erradicación, promulgación de leyes y decretos, para la fauna silvestre de cualquier país o región. El presente trabajo estudio la dieta de Bassariscus astutusmediante el análisis de sus excretas,con el objeto de ampliar el conocimiento ecológico y biológico de esta especie, al establecer su alimentación y variaciones en condiciones de bosque templado. Se analizó un total de 39 excretas recolectadas durante las visitas mensuales a la zona de estudio, de agosto del 2005 a julio del 2006. La riqueza taxonómica de su alimentación fue de 72 taxa, y estuvo comprendida en 5 grandes clases de alimento: Materia Vegetal, Insectos y Otros Artrópodos, Mamíferos, Aves y Reptiles. El Valor de Importancia Alimentaria (V.I.A.), reveló que en la zona de estudio el cacomixtle tiende al consumo especialista de materia vegetal (principalmente frutos y semillas), constituyendo la fuente primordial de alimento en su dieta tanto anual como mensualmente. Dentro de la materia animal se destacó el consumo de insectos, ubicándose anualmente como la segunda clase alimentaria más consumida por el prociónido, siguiendo en importancia la ingesta de mamíferos, aves y reptiles en este orden. De esta manera, la dieta del cacomixtle se estableció como principalmente frugívora e insectívora. Las fluctuaciones mensuales en la importancia del consumo de la materia vegetal y animal se relacionaron con la abundancia, disponibilidad y localización de dichos alimentos en el ambiente, así como con la demanda energética de B. astutusen sus épocas de reproducción y crianza. Para su etapa reproductiva se observó un consumo de animales tendienteal especialismo según el V.I.A., registrando un valor similar o cercano al de los vegetales, destacando la ingesta de mamíferos e insectos dentro de los grupos faunísticos en dicha época. En mayo y junio, los cambios en la importancia del consumo de los vegetales y animales se relacionaron más con ajustes de la especie por la temporada de parto, que a la disponibilidad y abundancia de estos alimentos en el ambiente. Considerando todos los taxa que conformaron la dieta, anualmente ninguno fue de gran importancia para el prociónido exhibiendo un consumo generalista (diversos alimentos poco consumidos) según el V.I.A., de los cuales el oyamel, el maíz, el capulín y las aves se ubicaron como los principales alimentos, sin embargo, la aparición del oyamel en ladieta se propone como accidental y la importancia de las aves se considera pudo estar sobrestimada. En contraste a lo anual, se observó que mensualmente algunos alimentos adquirieron gran importancia en la dieta, posiblemente relacionado a sus temporadas de disponibilidad y/o abundancia en el ambiente como en el caso de los frutos de capulín. El valor de Amplitud de Nicho Alimentario (0.35) indicó que anualmente la dieta del cacomixtle tiende a ser especialista por el consumo en mayor frecuencia de algunos alimentos como el maíz, materia vegetal no identificada, aves, coleópteros, capulín y abejas melíferas, sin embargo, el valor de Simpson (0.96) reflejó una alta diversidad de alimentos consumidos, pues son pocos los taxones que destacaron con un mayor número de apariciones y predominaron aquellos que fueron ingeridos en menor frecuencia, por lo que se atribuyó un carácter generalista en su alimentación. Se halló material de tipo inorgánico (constituida por restos de plástico, papel, rocas y carbón) en lasexcretas de la especie, el cual nos da indicios del empleo de fuentes no naturales y antropogénicas de alimento, siendo esta la cuarta vez que se registra su presencia en la dieta de B. astutus.

Manure removal is an ecosystem process related to several ecological functions performed by dung beetles. However, there is little information on manure removal by beetles in temperate ecosystems of Mexico. Using a linear model based on species biomass, here we estimated the amount of manure that can be potentially removed by dung beetle species in temperate forests and grasslands with sheep herding. Then, we related the estimated amount of manure removed with attributes of dung beetle communities: species richness, diversity, evenness and functional diversity in forest and grasslands sites. We compared the amount of manure potentially removed at each habitat by all species of dung beetles and by beetle’s food relocation strategies. Also, we used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to test the relationships between manure removal and community attributes. Our model estimated that five species remove most of the manure, and tunneler beetles remove higher amounts of manure in grasslands than in forest sites. GAMs revealed that manure removal is related to dung beetle species richness and evenness, but not to functional diversity. Therefore, it is relevant to promote rich dung beetle communities to maintain optimal ecosystem functions, both in native forest and livestock areas.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,10.1007/s42974-021-00043-w,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42974-021-00043-w,,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2021,,,,Ortega-Mart√≠nez IJ,,Moreno CE,,Arellano L,,Castellanos I,,Rosas F,,R√≠os-D√≠az CL,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the mammalian order Carnivora, the Miocene fossil musteloid Leptarctus has been variably interpreted as a carnivore, frugivore, herbivore, omnivore, or insectivore based on morphological comparisons with extant species. Here, we perform the first simulation of cranial biomechanics in Leptarctus primus, aiming to identify a living analogue using biomechanical capability rather than qualitative morphology. Finite element models (FEMs) of 18 extant carnivorans and two extinct outgroup taxa were used to compare known diet-biomechanics relationships with the biomechanical properties of L. primus FEMs within a phylogenetic context. Multivariate analyses of simulated bite efficiency and skull stiffness values indicate that L. primus is most similar overall to Taxidea taxus (American badger) in unilateral bite simulations. Based on biomechanical predictions, we postulate that L. primus resembled the American badger in its feeding ecology more closely than any other taxon tested and thus conclude that L. primus was dominantly a carnivore with an auxiliary feeding capability of omnivory. We also compared the L. primus FEMs with the potentially synonymous Hypsoparia bozemanensis to determine a possible range of feeding capabilities. We observed an increase in mechanical efficiency with a deepening of the zygomae of H. bozemanensis, a trait previously used to differentiate it from L. primus.

Traditionally, it is classified as an environmental disorder caused by low relative humidity, but other factors (temperature, dietary deficiencies, genetic susceptibility, and caging type) have also been proposed. Twenty litters of mice with ringtail lesions occurred from September 2010 to August 2013 in a facility located in the northern Italy. Mice were maintained under controlled environmental conditions and fed a standard diet. Retrospective analysis of environmental data (relative humidity, temperature) was carried out. Gross, histopathologic, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy examination of tails and limbs was performed. The incidence of ringtail was 0.075% (20/26 800) of all weaned litters over the 3-year period of examination.

Histologic and ultrastructural examination revealed abnormal keratin desquamation and presence of a keratin ring encircling the tail, causing progressive strangulation of the growing tail with subsequent compression and ulceration of underlying soft tissues, resulting in circulatory changes (edema, hyperemia, thrombosis, hemorrhages), ischemic necrosis, and eventually auto-amputation distal to the constriction.

Distributional studies were accomplished by soliciting sighting reports and by live trapping in Colorado from 1967 to 1976. Vocalizations of 14 captive ringtails were recorded and analyzed for behavioral context, frequency, amplitude and duration. Ten adult and subadult ringtails were studied with respect to their capacity to respond to increased dietary protein by the increase of urinary osmotic ceiling. Nine ringtails were tested under conditions of high and low protein diets and one ringtail was placed on a carnivorous diet lacking drinking water. The ringtail was determined to be present in at least 25 Colorado counties encompassing almost two-thirds of the state, absent only in the northeast third. One ringtail was found at 9,300' establishing an altitudinal record for Colorado. Six vocalizations of the ringtail were categorized based on their behavioral context: aggression (growl and bark), stress (ululation) and social (chitter, whistle, and grunt). The volcalizations ranged from 140 Hz to over 6kHZ in frequency, from 5 ms to over several minutes duration and up to 80 dB in amplidtude. The urine concentration of nine ringtails tested under the influence of water diuresis rose significantly (P>.001) following injection of vasopressin as compared with ringtails not so injected. The ringtails tested under conditions of a high protein diet showed a significantly higher plasma urea nitrogen level (mean of 17.9 mg/100mL) than under conditions of a low protein diet (8.7 mg/100). Ringtails under the high protein diet produced a mean urine osmolality of 1615 m0sm, significantly higher (P > .001) than the mean of 997 m0sm produced by the ringtails under low protein diet. The mean plasma osmolality of the two ringtail groups was not significantly (P > .001) different. The ringtails on the high protein diet also produced a mean urine/plasma ratio of 6.03 which was significantly higher than the mean of 3.80 produced by the ringtails on the low protein. Eight of the nine ringtails when tested on the low protein diet produced a double urine concentration peak in response to the two ADH injections. Eight of the nine ringtails tested on the high protein diet produced a single urine concentration peak. The ringtail maintained on the water free rodent diet for 23 days gained weight and produced a mean daily urine osmolality of 3188 m0sm with a range from 2549 to 3641 m0sm. The concentration of the urine on this diet correlated well with the intake of protein, indicating that the ringtail can increas the efficaciency of its urine concentrating mechanims with increased protein intake. A greater number of particles of solute per volume of urine resulted in the conservation of water by the ringtail. The achievment of a maximum urine concentration reported for a carnivore. The distributional studies show the proximity of the ringtail to water. The physiologcal studies demonstrate that when sufficient food is present the ringtail does not require drinking water to maintain water balance. This favors the hypothesis that the Colorado distribution of the ringtail is likely related to the obtainment of food rather than a requirement for drinking water.

Ringtails in Zion National Park, Utah, are rarely seen, but are involved in increasing occurrences of negative interactions with park visitors and employees such as food theft and denning in buildings, interactions which are harmful to both parties. To manage this conflict, an update to the general knowledge about the status of the population is required as the only previous study on ringtails in this area was conducted in the 1960s. Using noninvasive techniques provides dependable large-scale population information. I used two noninvasive detection methods in combination to establish a robust occupancy estimate of the ringtail population in Zion National Park. Ringtails were detected in 2 of 3 focus areas in the park, but at low densities. This study included the development of a novel method to individually identify ringtails by their footprints. I used the Interactive Individual Identification System (I3S) software to determine if individuals could be identified using the pattern formed by papillae and ridges of the footpad. Ringtails’ footpad prints consistently resulted in a unique pattern recognizable by simple visual analysis and a computer-aided analysis of the prints in a database; however more research is needed for the applicability using field data. Ringtail densities were highest in the areas of greatest human activity. The proximity to humans may be impacting ringtail diet and consequently their health. I collected scat in areas of high and low human use to quantify the change in diet resulting from food acquired around human establishments. Ringtails living in areas of high human activity exhibited a change in diet, including the presence of human trash such as foil and plastic; this has implications for ringtail health and human safety. Ringtails acquiring food from human sources may increase their activities around buildings and areas with high human activity, resulting in an increased chance of direct and indirect human-ringtail interactions. Active management of human activities and regular building maintenance is required in the future to decrease negative consequences of ringtail use and presence in areas of high human activity.",Utah State University,10.26076/75fb-1940,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/3866/,none,none,english,yes,expert curated,University Library,0,collegiate research,thesis,2014,https://paperpile.com/app/p/977da086-5305-0d54-8868-035a2a660498,,,Roadman AA,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,,

Improved analytic techniques have allowed primate researchers to reveal intricate social networks based on the exchange of cooperative acts and services. Although nonprimates are known to show similar behavior (e.g., cooperative hunting, food sharing, coalitions) there seems a consensus that social life is less complex than in primates. Here the authors present the first group-level analysis of reciprocity of social interactions in a social carnivore, the ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua). The authors found that support in aggressive conflicts is a common feature in coatis and that this behavior is reciprocally exchanged in a manner seemingly as complex as in primates. Given that reciprocity correlations persisted after controlling for the effect of spatial association and subunit membership, some level of scorekeeping may be involved. Further studies will be needed to confirm our findings and understand the mechanisms underlying such reciprocity, but our results contribute to the body of work that has begun to challenge primate supremacy in social complexity and cognition.",SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,10.1037/0735-7036.122.1.19,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-01944-003,none,,english,no,systematic search,UGA Library,0,,journal article,2008,https://paperpile.com/app/p/f819f7c6-f219-051c-baba-63237822b768,,,"Romero T,Aureli F",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the dissemination of Arctostaphylos pungens and Juniperus deppeana seeds by the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyote (Canis latrans), and other carnivores in the Protected Natural Area Sierra Fría, in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Scat collection was undertaken via transects using the direct search method, while the seasonal phenology of A. pungens and J. deppeana was evaluated by recording flower and fruit abundance on both the plant and the surrounding forest floor ground. Seed viability was assessed by optical densitometry via X-ray and a germination test. It was found that the gray fox, coyote, ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), and bobcat (Lynx rufus) disseminated seeds of A. pungens (212 ± 48.9 seeds/scat) and J. deppeana (23.6 ± 4.9 seeds/scat), since a large proportion of the collected scat of these species contained seeds (28/30 = 93.33%, 12/43 = 27.9%, 6/12 = 50% and 7/25 = 28% respectively). The gray fox, coyote, ringtail, and bobcat presented an average of seed dispersion of both plant species of 185.4 ± 228.7, 4.0 ± 20.0, 12.1 ± 30.4, and 0.8 ± 1.5 per scat; the seed proportions in the gray fox, coyote, ringtail, and bobcat were 89.6/10.4%, 82.3/17.7%, 90.4/9.6%, and 38.1/61.9% for A. pungens and J. deppeana, respectively. The phenology indicated a finding related to the greater abundance of ripe fruit in autumn and winter (p < .01). This coincided with the greater abundance of seeds found in scats during these seasons. Endozoochory and diploendozoochory enhanced the viability and germination of the seeds (p > .05), except in those of A. pungens dispersed by coyote. These results suggest that carnivores, particularly the gray fox, the coyote, and the bobcat, play an important role in forest seed dissemination, and thus forest regeneration, by making both a quantitative and qualitative contribution to the dispersal of the two pioneer species under study.",WILEY,10.1002/ece3.6113,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6113,https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.f7m0cfxrw,2045-7758,english,yes,systematic search,Publisher Website,0,science publisher,journal article,2020,https://paperpile.com/app/p/f80070f3-9f4d-0e0f-b5df-740ff5d35415,not needed,jsosar@correo.uaa.mx,Rubalcava‐Castillo FA,"Centro de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes,  Aguascalientes, México",Sosa‐Ramírez J,"Centro de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes,  Aguascalientes, México",Luna‐Ruíz JJ,"Centro de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes,  Aguascalientes, México",Valdivia‐Flores AG,"Centro de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes,  Aguascalientes, México",Díaz‐Núñez V,"Centro de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes,  Aguascalientes, México",Íñiguez‐Dávalos LI,"Departamento de Ecología y Recursos Naturales, Centro Universitario de la Costa  Sur, Universidad de Guadalajara, Autlán de  Navarro, Jalisco, México",none,none,,,,,,,,

Many social primates (and other species) are sensitive to cues about what others can and cannot see. Whether this sensitivity evolved in primates through shared descent or convergent evolution remains unclear. The current study tested gibbons—the apes that are least studied yet most distantly related to humans and one of the less social primates—in two food-competition tasks. Specifically, we presented eastern hoolock gibbons, Hoolock leuconedys, and silvery gibbons, Hylobates moloch, with a choice between a contested piece of food visible to both themselves and a human competitor and an uncontested piece visible only to themselves. Subjects successfully stole the uncontested food when the competitor turned away his body (N = 10, experiment 1) and his head (N = 9, experiment 2). However, when the head of the experimenter was oriented towards the contested piece of food, whether the competitor opened or closed his eyes made no difference. Subjects’ sensitivity to body- and head-orientation cues was comparable to that of chimpanzees, rhesus macaques, and ring-tailed lemurs—species living in much larger groups than gibbons.

Currently,  the Insular Complex, Espiritu Santo, is the main natural destination in La Paz and the  islands of the Sea of Cortez. And, every year, these NPA are visited by a great number of people, due to the increase of the tourism industry. However, human activity is the main threat to terrestrial ́s biota in these ecosystems. In this insular environment  lives  the  ringtail  (Bassariscus   astutus   saxicola)  an  endangered subspecies  and  a  unique  native  endemic  carnivore  in  the  island  with  a limited awareness about its ecology. This paper evaluates the influence of anthropogenic food on the diet and abundance of the ringtail in 8 locations of the Insular Complex, grouped together according to their level of anthropogenic concurrency (high and  low) by scat analysis, in order to determine the relevance of these resources as  well  as  the  abundance  of  the  species,  by  capturing  and  evaluating  its  body condition.  In  addition,  the  habitat  of  the  ringtail  was defined  based  on  the environmental  variables  of  the  sites  located  on  the  western  side of the insular  complex.

No significant differences in diet were found between seasons and sites with different levels of anthropogenic use or between individual sites (P = >0.05).  The  greater  abundance  of  the  ringtail was  registered  in  Candelero  and Mesteño sites (17 and 9 individuals respectively) unlike the lower abundance of Gallo and Ballena sites (1 and 3 individuals, respectively), determining a ratio of sexes in the Insular Complex of 1.63 males for each female. The evaluation of body condition of the ringtails, showed that the captured individuals enjoy of good  or regular condition (51 % and 42 % respectively),  while only 7 %  were  in  bad condition. A principal component analysis with environmental variables, showed a preference of ringtails for sites with larger rocks and greater coverage of zalate, presenting  the  Candelero  and  Mesteño  sites  these  characteristics,  which is consistent with the highest abundance in these sites.","Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste, S.C.",none,http://dspace.cibnor.mx:8080/handle/123456789/545 ,none,none,spanish,yes,expert curated,University Library,0,collegiate research,thesis,2016,https://paperpile.com/app/p/2b1a6db3-d6a9-056c-bda5-359ac7398de1,not-needed,not provided,Sansores Sánchez RE,"Programa de Estudios Posgrado, Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste S.

While the perceived benefits of chopped diets include reduced food aggression, it is acknowledged that chopping feeds is time consuming for keepers and increases the risk of contamination. Given the potential disadvantages of chopped diets, there is a need to evaluate food presentation in a range of zoo-housed species. To investigate the effects on behaviour and sociality, meals were provided as either chopped or whole for a group of ring-tailed coatis (Nasua nasua) housed at Beale Wildlife Park. Effects of food presentation change were monitored, with particular attention to aggression, allo-grooming, food manipulation and activity levels. Surprisingly, analysis revealed a significant decrease in aggression, (p = 0.046), and a significant increase in food manipulation behaviours (p < 0.001) when unchopped foods were given. Levels of inactivity were not significantly changed by the new food presentation technique (p = 0.793). A positive correlation was also identified between bouts of aggression and allo-grooming (p < 0.001). These results suggest that chopped food may not provide all the behavioural benefits originally believed, and whole food diets may in fact provide coatis with greater opportunities to express natural food manipulation behaviours. Whole food may also decrease aggression levels normally observed during mealtimes.

Birds obtained as wild caught adults have exhibited good survival and some reproduction in the wild. Captive-reared birds have had, poor survival rates due mainly to deficits in foraging and socialization, and to heavy losses to predators. Although parent-reared, captive- bred birds have performed better than hand-reared birds, and young captive-bred birds have done better than older captive-bred birds, the only birds showing good potentials for reestablishment have been translocated wild-caught adults. Present habitat quality in southern Arizona appears adequate to support a population of these parrots, but it is questionable that the species might sustain consistent populations north of the range of Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla).

In the most favorable parts of this area its numbers may approximate 10 to the section (640 acres). The earliest pregnancy in this region was recorded April 16, the latest May 7, indicating a relatively concentrated breeding period. The young number two to four. The earliest young were born May 13. By August 10, the young were nearly full-grown. In this region ringtails den in cracks or crevices in rocks, in hollow logs or hollow trees. Skins of the ringtail retain their primeness until about April 1, considerably longer than the raccoon or skun. The ringtail has been used as a pet since the gold-rush days of California. A wide range of food is eaten, both plant and animal in character. The contents of the entire alimentary tracts (including stomach, small intestine, and colon) of 256 ringtails were analyzed to obtain information on food eaten in this area. In the fall insects made up the largest single item of food, with plant material next, and mammals and birds following in the order.

Data were gathered mostly between June, 1967 and September, 1968, in Zion Canyon, Zion National Park, by means of radio telemetry, visual observations, and collection of droppings. The principal conclusions are: (1) Habitats of the two species largely overlap. Their hom range sizes are statistically similar (X = 136 ha for 13 Bassariscus; X = 107 ha for 8 Urocyon), but distribution of telemetric data over five vegetation types (riparian woodland, brushy meadows, blackbrush shurbland, pinon-juniper woodland, and ""miscellaneous"" areas) indicate a difference in use-intensity significant at the 0.001 level, when data were subjected to a chi-square test.

Ringtails made heavier use of blackbrush and ""miscellaneous"" areas (e.g., buildings), especially the former. use of riparian and pinon-juniper woodlands was similar for the two species. (2) Gray foxes and ringtails differ in the specific manner with which each uses its habitat. Ringtails forage on, under, and above the ground surface; foxes use primarily the ground surface. The gray fox usually walks or runs on the ground; the ringtail has special behavioral and morphological adaptations that allow it to negotiate cliffs, crevices, rough talus, trees, and subterranean spaces. Although 1/6 to 1/3 the weight of gray foxes, ringtails appear to travel greater nocturnal distances per unit time. (3) Temporal use of habitat differs interspecifically: ringtails are essentailly nocturnal, while gray foxes, though active mostly at night, also forage diurnally and crepuscularly, taking prey species relatively more available at the these times. (4) Analysis of food item frequencies of 240 gray fox and 227 ringtail droppings evenly distrubuted over a year's time, indicated extensive overlap in foods unsed, but showed many significant differences in use-intensity of particular foods during a given month or season.

Sin embargo, los estu- dios sobre su ecología y comportamiento dentro de las urbes son limitados. El presente trabajo tuvo como objetivo conocer la distribución geográfica del caco- mixtle norteño por medio de ciencia ciudadana, así como sus hábitos alimentarios en la Ciudad de México. Los registros de cacomixtles se obtuvieron de publicacio- nes en Facebook, Twitter, Naturalista y periódicos electrónicos. Además, se reali- zaron análisis espaciales para identificar si existía una relación entre la presencia de cacomixtles, las áreas verdes y la densidad poblacional humana. Durante el periodo del estudio, se registraron 788 avistamientos en la CDMX. Todas las al- caldías presentaron al menos un avistamiento. Los resultados mostraron que en la mayoría de las alcaldías la distancia de los registros de cacomixtles a las áreas agrícolas fue significativamente más alta que la distancia a las áreas protegidas, y ésta última significativamente más alta que la registrada a las áreas verdes urba- nas. Por otro lado, uno de los modelos utilizados indicó una relación significativa negativa entre el porcentaje de áreas verdes en una cuadrícula de 127 ha y el nú- mero de cacomixtles, y una relación positiva con la densidad poblacional humana. Asimismo, se colectaron 46 excretas, durante el periodo correspondiente a marzo- octubre de 2021, de las cuales se identificaron 140 elementos, entre los que se encuentran plantas, mamíferos y artrópodos.

El interés principal de las investigaciones acerca de los hábitos alimentarios de los mamíferos es el de conocer qué recursos de un ecosistema son consumidos, el cómo, cuándo y de dónde los obtienen. Estos se realizan con el fin de brindar información necesaria para el manejo y conservación de las poblaciones animales. Por tanto, el presente estudio tuvo como finalidad conocer los hábitos alimentarios del Cacomixtle (Bassariscus astutus) en la comunidad “Las Ánimas”, del municipio de Chapa de Mota, Estado de México, a través del análisis de excretas y otros rastros indirectos por un lapso de un año. Se colectaron y analizaron un total de 220 excretas encontrando 47 tipos de alimento comprendidos en 5 grandes grupos (materia vegetal, mamíferos, aves, reptiles e insectos). El valor de importancia alimenticia(VIA) anual, reveló que la Materia Vegetal, Insectos y Mamíferos fueron los más relevantes, aunque varían estacionalmente; las Aves y los Reptiles sólo fueron un complemento de la dieta. Los frutos y granos, como el Maíz, el Capulín,el Amaranto, pequeños Mamíferos (musarañas y roedores), e Insectos(escarabajos y otros coleópteros) fueron los principales componentes de la dieta. El alto consumo de Maíz por parte del organismo es un posible indicador de que las poblaciones humanas y las áreas de cultivo han alcanzado su habitad y área de distribución.

The species composition was as follows: raccoons, 40.9%; striped skunks, 17.5%; opossums, 14.9%; gray foxes, 13.5%; ringtails, 8.4%; feral house cats, 2.5% bobcat, striped skunk, and red fox, each 0.6%. 2. The population, determined by a ratio of house cats to other furbearers, indicated on raccoon to 9.4 acres, one striped skunk to 25.2 acres, one opossum to 29.7 acres, one gray fox to 32.6 acres, one ringtail to 52.4 acres, and one bobcat to 914.2 acres. 3. Edges created by clearing were the most important habitats for raccoons, gray foxes, red foxes, and feral house cats. Opossums were the most abundant around human settlements. Ringtails, striped skunks, and spotted skunks were most abundant in the climax condition. 4. Live trapping studies suggested that racoons and possibly opossums are nomadic. Raccoons seem to have a shifting range with the center of activity remaining in one locality no longer than one month. 5. Aging methods were determined for raccoons, opossums, and ringtails. Raccoons were separated in five age groups by the amount of wear on the teeth. Adult opossums were spearated into three age groups by the basal length of the skull and by total weight of the animal. Ringtails were placed in three groups on the basis of development of the baculum. 6. Raccoons began breeding in late January and 43.7% of the females had bred or were receptive by the end of February. The number of young per litter based on embyo counts was 2.8, placental scar counts 3.6, and number of young counts 3.5. The primary sex ratio was 1.0 male to 1.2 femails; the secondary ratio of males to females was 1.0 to 1.8. The coefficient of birth was found to be 1.5. Accordingly, the population will be increased 1.5 times after the young are produced. Theorettically, 33.3% of the fall population can be removed, from the area studied, without depleating the breeding reserve. Opossums began breeding in early January and had two periods of production - (1) January, February, March; (2) June and July. The average number per litter was eight. The ratio of adult males to adult females was 1.7 to 1.0. Gray foxes began breeding in January and produced an average of 4.6 young per litter. The sex ratio of adult males to adult females was 1.0 to 1.09. 7. All upland furbearers are omnivorous, their food havits being neutral or beneficial to agriculature. Fruits, insects, rodents, and cottontails were the most important food items. Foods eaten by raccoons appeared in the scats for several days. The bulk of mammal remains was not passed until the second day after feeding. A quantitative analysis of scats was found to be a reliable method of determining the foods eaten. A comparative study of the sections of gut showed that contents of the colon and small intestine were often as reliable in food anlayses as stomach content alone. The should be included in any analysis. 8. Agricultural practices are beneficial to furbearers. Food supplies are improved by opening areas and allowing them to become established with fruit producing plants. More prey species are present as a result of the variety of nices created. Overgrazing aids the establishment of fruit producing plants in pastures, and improves woodland habitats by increasing the intensity of underbrush. 9. Raccoon pelts became prime in late November and remained in this condition until mid-January. Ringtail pelts lost their prime condition by mid-January. Gray fox hides taking in the first half of January were prime. Striped skunk pelts were prime from November to early February. 10. Furbearers harbor both internal and external parasites. The most common external parasites were fleas and ticks. Round worms and tape worms were common in the digestive tracts. They were found in 75% of the gray foxes, 95% of the raccoons, all of the opossums, all of the striped skunks and 9.09% of the ringtails. 11.

For the raccoon, an analysis based on scats was found to be as reliable as one based on digestive tract contents. It is suggested, however, that when the digestive tract is used for an analysis, the colon as well as the stomach contents be included in the study. The stomach of the opossum was found to be the most reliable section of the gut upon which to base an analysis and the content of the stomach is a more reliable indicator of foods eaten than are the scats. For the gray fox, the analysis indicated that scats give as reliable an indication of foods eaten as do the digestive tract contents. These data suggest that either the stomach or the small intestine is satisfactory for analyses but it is suggested that both be included in a study.

Research was conducted to determine home range size and overlap, habitat use, and food habits during 1990 and 1991. Sources of Data Radiotelemetry locations of radiocollared ringtails were gathered on eight animals at Abbott Lake. The telemetry portion of the study was conducted from January through April 1990 and November 1990 through May 1991. For the food habits study, 172 scats were collected from December 1989 through November 1990 and grouped into four divisions of 3 months each. The scats were analyzed for contents at the California State University, Sacramento. Conclusions Reached Ringtail home range sizes ranged from 5.3 to 21.4 ha (13.1- 52.9 acres) and averaged 12.0 ha (29.7 acres). The male ringtails had home ranges of 12.7-21.4 ha (31.4-52.9 acres) with an average of 16.2 ha (40.0 acres). Female ringtails ranged from 5.3 to 9.7 ha (13.1-24.0 acres) and averaged 7.9 ha (19.5 acres). A density estimate was calculated which indicated 28.7 ringtails/km^ (74 ringtails/mi^) . Both intersexual and intrasexual home range overlap occurred. Male overlap of female home ranges ranged from 4.3 to 99.0 percent. Intrasexual overlap averaged 43.7 percent among males and 9.4 percent among females. The analysis of Vegetation cover types were identified at Abbott Lake by determining the dominant overstory vegetation. The cottonwood riparian/willow designation was dominated by Populus fremontii and Salix gooddinaii: mixed riparian/open by Pi fremontii. Salix spp.. Acer neaundo. Platanus racemosa.

The analysis of habitat use in different vegetation cover types indicated a statistically significant level of preference or avoidance in one-third of the cover types (P < 0.10). Male ringtails avoided mixed riparian and cottonwood/willow/open overstory vegetation cover types and preferred the mixed riparian/open cover type. Female ringtails avoided mixed riparian/willow, cottonwood/willow/open, and willow overstory vegetation cover types. Among all ringtails, mixed riparian and cottonwood/willow/open cover types were avoided and cottonwood/open cover was preferred. The scat analysis found that mammals were the most consumed items on an annual basis. Seasonally, mammals were the dominant food items during the winter (December-February) and spring (March-May) and fruits were dominant during the summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November). Black or Norway rats (Rattus sp.), California meadow voles (Micrptus californicus) , blackberries (Rubus sp.) , and '-.v California wild grapes (Vitis californica) were the dominant food items. Invertebrates, birds, and reptiles were lesser components of the ringtails' diet.",California State University Sacramento,none,none,none,none,english,no,expert curated,UGA Library,11,collegiate research,dissertation,1993,https://paperpile.com/app/p/d93889a3-85b2-041d-9bfe-095501eacc43,,not provided,Wyatt DT,,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,calculated mean diet items per scat based on reported values (343 diet items in 172 scat) ,

Four ringtails  (2 males,  2 females)  were captured and fitted with radio-transmitter collars.  Home ranges were determined using the atypical habitat elimination method.  The average home range was 19.8 ha  (SD 3.4 ha)  with ranges from 16.1 to 22.8 ha.  Intrasexual overlap of home ranges did not occur and both female home ranges overlapped at least one male's home range.  Annually, males traveled more than females;  in fall, winter, and spring males traveled more than females;  in summer, females traveled more than males.  Distance traveled decreased in the summer and during the middle of the night.  On an annual basis, both males and females used riparian areas and avoided oak/mesquite areas;  females also selected juniper habitats.  By season, the use of different types of habitats differed between sexes.  Forty-six percent of the den sites used were trees, 38% were rocks, and 16% were brushpiles. When den use was partitioned seasonally and by sex, differences in den selection may have related to reproductive activity.  Food items consumed in terms of frequency of occurrence were fruit,  insects, and small vertebrates.  In summer, arthropods were most frequent;  in fall and winter, fruits were eaten most; in spring, mammals and arthropods were eaten most.",Northern Arizona University,none,none,yes,none,english,no,expert curated,UGA Library,8,collegiate research,thesis,1988,https://paperpile.com/app/p/7672d0b6-623b-06d0-bd88-c73aea0af002,,not provided,Yarchin J,"Department of Biology, Northern Arizona University",none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,,,,,,,specifed twice per month collection,
