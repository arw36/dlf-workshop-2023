In Hokkaido, Japan, although the prevalence among inhabitants has been very low, the areas infested with the parasite are rapidly spreading in recent years. Therefore, we improved on the procedure of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (micro-ELISA) for serological diagnosis of multilocular echinococcosis to carry out the epidemiological survey. A micro-ELISA plate (M129A, DYNATECH), antigen of E. multilocularis cyst extract, peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (MILES-YEDA), O-phenylenediamine and a plate reader (Multiskan MC, TITERTEK) were used for the assay. Reactions were performed with 0.1 ml of reagents in wells of plate at each step and 0.1 ml of 0.2N H2SO4 was finally added for stop of the reaction. The optimum condition was determined by block titration, as 10 micrograms/ml of protein for antigen concentration, 1:40 for serum dilution and 1:4,000 for conjugate dilution. In this assay system, 30 serum samples could be examined in one plate. After correcting the absorbance of negative control to 0.300, positive range was defined as more than 0.600 which was twice the value of negative control. Doubtful positive range was defined as between 0.450 and 0.600, and negative range as less than 0.450. According to this criterion, 30 serum samples of proven patients with multilocular echinococcosis were examined. Positive and doubtful positive reactions were found from 20 sera (66.7%) and 7 sera (23.3%), respectively.

The first patient was diagnosed in 1936 and 131 patients have been authorized as echinococcosis so far. The conference of measures against the outbreak had been organized in 1948 and started to eradicate Echinococcus multilocularis from the Island. Medical examination to detect the patients and the capture and autopsy of dogs and cats had been carried out hard till 1970. At that time, foxes imported from Simusiru Island in the middle Kuriles during the years 1924 to 1926 had already disappeared and it has seemed to be sure that stray dogs and cats might carry E. multilocularis and excrete infectious eggs in stead of foxes. Since we have had no real data concerning the natural history of patients with echinococcosis without any treatments, it can not be recognized the time of infection and the role of dogs or cats on the spread of echinococcosis at Rebun Island. From the new data, it is concluded that the active life cycle of E. multilocularis between foxes and vole might be closed by 1940, since the last patient infected with E. multilocularis was born in 1940 and died in 1945. Furthermore, it is estimated that more than 200 patients (3 to 4% of people at the island) might die from echinococcosis, because of the fact of the unusual increase of mortality of liver disorders and oldness observed during the years of 1940 to 1960. 81 patients with the high possibility of echinococcosis detected from 1937 to 1963 can be added to 131 authorized patients. Surprisingly, it is noticed that the standard deviations of ages of death of 94 patients born in Meiji era (1880-1912) and 59 in Taisho and Showa eras (1912-1940) are 63.16 +/- 11.68, and 34.32 +/- 11.87, respectively. It means that both old and young people might be infected simultaneously but for the long period. There was no difference between the susceptibility of young and old men to E. multilocularis. The numbers of male patients died were more than those of female patients at the ages from 30s to 60s while the number of female died was predominant after 70s. All 13 familial cases of echinococcosis represent that men might bring the infectious eggs into their houses and died earlier by the infection. Thus, the sexual difference might be due to the life style of men who preferred hunting beside fishing. From these results, it is conceivable that the heavy infection of E. multilocularis excreted from foxes might occur from 1925 to 1940 and the peak of the death might be formed during 1940 to 1965. The eradication of foxes might be done by poachers after 1935 and the adaptation of E. multilocularis from fox to dog or cat might not occur readily at Rebun Island.",Yes,Japanese,,,,,"EID_242, EID_243",,NA,,Snowballing

The number of pets was also examined by questionnaire targeting 3 aviation and 3 ferry companies. The number of dogs imported from overseas was examined with the Annual Reports of the Animal Quarantine Service of Japan, The sanitary conditions of hotels for pet owners were also examined with a questionnaire. Approximately 140 pet dogs were found to have officially moved annually from Hokkaido to Honshu during the study period. However, the actual number might be two to three times this estimate, because many dogs moved without notification. Nearly ten thousand pet dogs were transported a year to and from Honshu and Hokkaido by planes and ferries. A value of three thousand would be expected if people from Hokkaido were accompanying their pets at the rate of the registered dogs per population, one animal per 23 Hokkaido residents. Up to 30 pet dogs infested with E. multilocularis would probably be included per year, according to the infestation rate of 1% in Hokkaido. The number of imported dogs from overseas was assessed at approximately 15 thousand a year, but these dogs were not obligated to receive animal quarantine with respect to echinococcal infestation in Japan. Hotels for pet owners were considered to be managed rather sanitarily, though certain administrative guidance is necessary to prevent hydatid disease infection of travelers and hotel workers. The authors consider that dogs from Hokkaido and also from echinococcosis endemic countries should undergo fecal examination for parasite eggs to prevent invasion of the parasite into Honshu.

The densities of fox and grassland rodent populations and the interactions between them influence E. multilocularis transmission rates in Europe. Successful rabies control has caused fox populations and E. multilocularis prevalence rates to increase in many European countries. The potential increase of the infection pressure on the human population motivates the monitoring of the infection status of foxes over space and time. Detection of E. multilocularis antigen levels in fox faecal samples collected in the field might provide a pragmatic methodology for epidemiological surveillance of the infection status in wildlife hosts across large areas, as well as providing an indication of the spatial distribution of infected faeces contaminating the environment. In this paper, a spatial analysis of antigen levels detected in faeces collected in the Franche-Comt√ç¬© region of eastern France is presented. In Franche-Comt√ç¬©, rodent outbreaks have been observed to originate in areas rich in grassland. Spatial trends in fox infection levels were modelled here as a function of the composition ratio of grassland in the landscape derived from the CORINE land-cover map. Kriging models incorporating the grassland trend term were compared to a variety of models in which five alternative trend expressions were used: the alternative trend expressions included linear and quadratic polynomials on the x and y coordinates with and without a grassland term, and a constant mean model. Leave-one-out cross-validation indicated that the estimation errors of kriging with a trend models were significantly lower when the trend expression contained the grassland index term only. The relationship between observed and predicted antigen levels was strongest when the estimated range of autocorrelation was within the home range size of a single fox. The over-dispersion of E. multilocularis in foxes may therefore account for the majority of spatial autocorrelation locally, while regional trends can be successfully modelled as a function of habitat availability for intermediate hosts.",Yes,English,,,location size,EID_045,,,NA,,SystematicSearch

Human hydatid disease occurs in almost all pastoral communities and rangeland areas of the underdeveloped and developed world. Control programmes against hydatidosis have been implemented in several endemic countries, states, provinces, districts or regions to reduce or eliminate cystic echinococcosis (CE) as a public health problem. This review assesses the impact of 13 of the hydatid control programmes implemented, since the first was introduced in Iceland in 1863. Five island-based control programmes (Iceland, New Zealand, Tasmania, Falklands and Cyprus) resulted, over various intervention periods (from <15 to >50 years), in successful control of transmission as evidenced by major reduction in incidence rates of human CE, and prevalence levels in sheep and dogs. By 2002, two countries, Iceland and New Zealand, and one island-state, Tasmania, had already declared that hydatid disease had been eliminated from their territories. Other hydatid programmes implemented in South America (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay), in Europe (mid-Wales, Sardinia) and in East Africa (northwest Kenya), showed varying degrees of success, but some were considered as having failed. Reasons for the eventual success of certain hydatid control programmes and the problems encountered in others are analysed and discussed, and recommendations for likely optimal approaches considered.

The North today is in transition, facing increased resource extraction, globalisation of trade and travel, and rapid and accelerating environmental change. This comprehensive review addresses the diversity, distribution, ecology, epidemiology, and significance of nine zoonotic parasites in animal and human populations in the North. Based on a qualitative risk assessment with criteria heavily weighted for human health, these zoonotic parasites are ranked, in the order of decreasing importance, as follows: Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella and Giardia, Echinococcus granulosus/canadensis and Cryptosporidium, Toxocara, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes. Recent and future trends in the importance of these parasites for human health in the North are explored. For example, the incidence of human exposure to endemic helminth zoonoses (e.g. Diphyllobothrium, Trichinella, and Echinococcus) appears to be declining, while water-borne protozoans such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Toxoplasma may be emerging causes of human disease in a warming North. Parasites that undergo temperature-dependent development in the environment (such as Toxoplasma, ascarid and anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) will likely undergo accelerated development in endemic areas and temperate-adapted strains/species will move north, resulting in faunal shifts. Food-borne pathogens (e.g. Trichinella, Toxoplasma, anisakid nematodes, and diphyllobothriid cestodes) may be increasingly important as animal products are exported from the North and tourists, workers, and domestic animals enter the North. Finally, key needs are identified to better assess and mitigate risks associated with zoonotic parasites, including enhanced surveillance in animals and people, detection methods, and delivery and evaluation of veterinary and public health services.",Yes,English,,no E. multi data,,,,,NA,review; no data,Snowballing

Human infection is characterized by the development of a cancer-like hepatic mass, which may extend to adjacent structures or metastasize to distant sites. If the infection goes untreated, mortality reaches 80%. The medical records of all patients with alveolar hydatid disease diagnosed or treated at the Alaska Native Medical Center between 1951 and 1993 were reviewed. Forty-two cases of active disease are presented. Nine patients underwent resection of hepatic lesions with intent to cure, and each had a favorable result. Average post-diagnosis survival of those patients was 22 years; six still are living and free of disease. Partial resections or drainage procedures were performed in ten patients. Chemotherapy was used to augment the surgical treatment of eight patients, and four received chemotherapy alone, resulting in improved outcomes compared with historic controls. Late complications included hepatic abscess, biliary obstruction, and portal venous hypertension. Whereas alveolar hydatid disease rarely is encountered in other areas of North America, the biologic potential for spread of the disease may be increasing because of illegal importation of infected foxes to the Eastern seaboard. Therefore, the surgical community should maintain an awareness of the diagnosis and management of this potentially devastating parasitic infection.",not-needed,English,human,,,,,,NA,,Snowballing

The objective was to prevent dispersal of infective eggs of the cestode within the village by means of monthly treatments of dogs with praziquantel. Northern voles, Microtus oeconomus, present in the village as commensals, served as an index of risk, as the incidence of infection in the voles provides information about the availability of eggs within the confines of the inhabited area. Voles were examined annually during early June before the population of overwintering voles was diluted by the first annual litters. The pretreatment infection-rate within the village was 29% (range 22-35%), and in control areas at some distance from the village for the entire study period it averaged 53% (284 infected voles from a sample of 533). Some fluctuation in incidence of infection in village voles occurred, apparently depending on the extent to which the residents kept their dogs chained and thus available for treatment. The success of the programme was demonstrated by the reduction in prevalence of infection to about 1% of voles in 1985, and an average infection rate during the last five years of the study of 5% (29 infected voles in a sample of 582). This 83% average reduction in the prevalence of the larval cestode within the village reflects a corresponding reduction in the risk of acquiring by the residents of the village.

From 146 male and 3 female hunters originating from the south-eastern Austrian federal states of Styria and Burgenland blood samples were taken and anamnestic data were obtained using a questionnaire. The serological investigations included the following viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonotic agents or zoonoses, respectively (antibody-seroprevalences in brackets): encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV, 15%), Puumala-Hantavirus (10%), Newcastle Disease virus (NDV, 4%), borreliosis (IgG 42%, IgM 7%), brucellosis (1%), chlamydiosis (3%), ehrlichiosis (IgG 15%, IgM 3%), leptospirosis (10%), tularaemia (3%), Q fever (0%), Echinococcus multilocularis/E. granulosus (5%/11%), toxocariasis (17%). Out of a control group of 50 persons (urban population, no hunters) only one person was found to be seropositive for Toxocara canis and NDV and four for EMCV, all other results were negative in the control group. The high seroprevalences especially to Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Ehrlichia spp., Leptospira interrogans, E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, encephalomyocarditis virus and Puumala virus demonstrate that hunters are particularly exposed to zoonotic pathogens. It should also be noted that one hunter was seropositive for Brucella abortus and five exhibited antibodies to Francisella tularensis. In these cases, as well as in the cases of the 15 seropositives for Leptospira interrogans, the suspected source of infection may--besides rodents--also include wild boars and brown hares.

It is unclear, however, if the wider distribution is due to its recent spreading or to a lack of previous data from the new areas. Italy, previously considered E. multilocularis-free, is now part of these new areas: infected foxes (the main definitive host of the tapeworm) have been observed in a Northern Alpine territory. Thus, more surveys need to be done in other Italian regions in order to monitor the spreading of E. multilocularis. The aim of the present study was to look for this parasite in 283 foxes collected in an Apennine area of Central Italy by different diagnostic methods. RESULTS: The foxes were heavily parasitized by 11 helminthic genera, but none of the animals was infected by E. multilocularis neither by E. granulosus (harboured adult worms or their DNA). Low specificity was observed in commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of E. multilocularis antigens in the faeces. Molecular diagnostics were sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of tapeworm eggs in faeces, but less sensitive, although specific, to adult tapeworms in the intestinal content. CONCLUSION: Preliminarily, we can say that no E. multilocularis could be found in the study area. These data will enable us to follow temporal changes of the spatial distribution of the parasite in the study area of the Central Apennines. Due to its low specificity the ELISA kit for E. multilocularis coproantigens is not suitable for epidemiological surveys, whereas molecular diagnostics applied to faecal samples give useful results. Finally, absence of E. granulosus in foxes living in the endemic areas studied confirms the thought that this tapeworm prefers a different definitive host.",Yes,English,,,non standard location,GMPD_051,,,NA,,SystematicSearch

Preliminary ecological results show that the population density of foxes in the urban are is high and the animals have small homeranges. Within the city border, the prevalence of Echinococcus multilocularis in foxes increased significantly from the urban (47%) to the adjacent recreational labor (67%). To estimate the contamination of city areas with eggs of E. multilocularis, faecal samples of foxes were collected and investigated by coproantigen ELISA. The spatial distribution of coproantigen positive samples was in accordance with the different prevalences found in necropsied foxes. In rodents trapped in recreational areas of the city, E. multicularis metacestodes were identified by morphological examination, by EmG11-antigen detection with ELISA and by PCR. The prevalence in 781 Arvicola terrestris was 9.2% with fully developed protoscolices (14-240,000) occurring in 24 A. terrestris.

notification rate has stabilised. In food and animals no EU trends were observed and the occurrence of
Campylobacter continued to be high in broiler meat at EU level. The decreasing EU trend in confirmed human
salmonellosis cases observed in recent years continued. Most Member States met their Salmonella reduction
targets for poultry. In foodstuffs, the reported EU-level Salmonella non-compliance in fresh poultry meat
decreased. Human listeriosis increased further, showing an increasing EU trend in 2009-2013. In ready-to-eat
foods Listeria was seldom detected above the legal safety limit. Also during 2009-2013, a decreasing EU trend
was observed in confirmed yersiniosis cases. Positive findings for Yersinia were mainly reported in pig meat and
products thereof. The number of confirmed verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) infections in humans
increased. VTEC was reported from food and animals. A total of 5,196 food-borne outbreaks, including waterborne outbreaks, were reported in the EU. Most food-borne outbreaks were caused by Salmonella, followed by
viruses, bacterial toxins and Campylobacter, whereas in 28.9 % of all outbreaks the causative agent was
unknown. Important food vehicles in strong-evidence food-borne outbreaks were eggs and egg products,
followed by mixed food, and fish and fish products. The report further summarises trends and sources along the

The infection can beacquired directly from animals, or through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. The gravity of these diseasesin humans can vary from mild symptoms to life threatening conditions.In order to prevent these diseases from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs arethe main sources of the infections. For this purpose and to follow the developments in the European Union(EU), information is collected and analysed from all EU Member States in order to help the Community toimprove control measures in the food production chain aimed to protect human health.In 2006, twenty-four Member States submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents,antimicrobial resistance and food-borne outbreaks to the European Commission and the European FoodSafety Authority (EFSA). Further information on zoonoses cases in humans was acquired from the EuropeanCentre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The information covered 17 diseases. Assisted by itsZoonoses Collaboration Centre, EFSA and ECDC jointly analysed the information and published the results inthis annual Community Summary Report. In addition, six countries that were not EU Member States providedinformation on zoonoses for the report.Although a small decrease in the cases was observed in 2006 as compared to 2005, campylobacteriosisremained the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans in EU with 175,561 reported confirmedcases in 2006. Salmonellosis was again the second most commonly recorded zoonosis accounting for160,649 confirmed human cases. However, the incidence of salmonellosis has decreased in the EU over thepast years, and in the last three years this decrease has been statistically significant.In foodstuffs, the highest proportion of Campylobacter positive samples was reported for fresh poultry meat,where on average 35% samples were found positive. Campylobacter was also commonly found from livepoultry, pigs and cattle. Of particular concern is the high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin observed in theseCampylobacter findings, ranging from 30.6% to 56.7% of the isolates. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic commonlyused to treat human campylobacteriosis, and this resistance limits the therapeutic options available and maylead to treatment failure.Salmonella was most often found in fresh poultry and pig meat where proportions of positive samples onaverage of 5.6% and 1.0% were detected, respectively. However, the majority of the reported food-borneSalmonella outbreaks were related to eggs while meat was the second most common cause. In animalpopulations, Salmonella was most frequently detected in poultry flocks. The Salmonella prevalence in flocksof laying hens and their breeding flocks has decreased significantly at EU level, which possibly indicates thesuccess of the control measures taken in the sector. No such trends were observed in flocks of broilers.The number of listeriosis cases has significantly increased in EU over the 5 past years and in 2006 a total of1,583 human cases were reported. Listeriosis is an important food-borne zoonosis due to the severity of thedisease and high mortality related to it. In 2006, the reported mortality in connection with the food-bornelisteriosis outbreaks was 14.2%. The Listeria bacteria were most often reported above the legal safety limitfrom ready-to-eat (RTE) fishery products, followed by cheeses and other RTE products.Salmonella was once again the main cause of reported food-borne outbreaks in EU but for the first time, foodborne viruses were the second most frequent cause. The number of viral outbreaks is assumed to be severelyunderreported in the previous years.The reported incidences of yersiniosis and VTEC infection have decreased in EU, but these diseases stillaccounted for 8,979 and 4,916 human cases in 2006, respectively. VTEC and Yersinia bacteria were reportedmainly from cattle, pigs and products thereof.The two parasitic zoonoses, trichinellosis and echinococcosis, caused 231 and 458 human cases each in EUMember States. In animals, these parasites were mainly isolated in wildlife.At EU level, the occurrence of bovine tuberculosis slightly increased and that of bovine and sheep/goatbrucellosis decreased in the Member States, which are not free of these diseases, compared to 2005. Inhumans 1,033 brucellosis cases were reported mainly by the non-free Member States.No cases of rabies were reported in humans in 2006.

After hierarchical clustering analyses, the EmsB target enabled us to distinguish two main assemblages, each divided into sub-groups, yielding the differentiation of six clusters or assemblage profiles. Thirteen foxes (52% of the foxes) each harbored worms from at least two different assemblage profiles, suggesting they had become infected by several sources. Using the NAK1 target, we identified 3 alleles, two found in association with the two EmsB assemblages. With the NAK1 target, we investigated the parasite breeding system and the possible causes of genetic diversification.

General expansion of the range of E. multilocularis has been observed across Europe over the last 15years. In France, a westward spread of the known endemic areas of the parasite was described recently. For genotyping, the microsatellite EmsB was used to trace expansion in five French areas. A total of 22 EmsB profiles were identified, with five similar to those previously described in other parts of Europe. An imbalance of genetic diversity was observed between the five areas which also revealed their interconnection with the presence of common profiles, notably the two main profiles both present in all regions except one in the North. These two findings are similar to those described at the European level, highlighting transmission of the parasite by a mainland-island system. A spatio-temporal scenario of the expansion of E. multilocularis can be proposed with spread from the French historical focus in eastern France to the Lorraine, the Champagne-Ardenne and finally the North, while simultaneously another expansion has occurred from the historical focus into the West. The colonization by the parasite into the West and North areas from the historical focus was probably due to the migration of foxes several decades ago. Recent detection of the parasite in new endemic ""d√ï¬©partements"" may be due to more active research rather than a recent spread of the parasite.

The average worm count increased from 2.6 worms per fox in the first surveillance to 16.6 worms per fox in the second.

Six study sites were selected in a high endemicity area and two study sites in a low endemicity area in eastern France on the basis of landscape composition. Sampling was undertaken in the winters of 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. At each site, (i) necropsy and intestine examination was undertaken on a sample of shot foxes (total number of foxes, 222), and (ii) fox faeces were collected in the field along road verges, and scored for degradation status (total number of faeces, 625). Fox faeces were also sampled in a control area (n=30) in western France in the summer of 1998. Intestines were examined according to the sedimentation method. Echinococcus multilocularis coproantigens were detected by using two ELISA tests: EM-ELISA and EmA9-ELISA. The necropsy prevalence in high and low endemicity areas was 63.3% and 19.4%, respectively, and the distribution of adult worms in the fox population was highly overdispersed (75.5% of the total biomass was harboured by 11.6% of foxes). Using the two ELISA tests, there was no difference in the detection of E. multilocularis coproantigens in field faeces, regardless of the degradation status. The medians of EM- and EmA9-ELISA OD values of field faeces in high endemicity area were significantly higher than in low endemicity area (P<0.001 for both ELISA).

The decline occurred when 31% of the grassland area was treated with bromadiolone, an anticoagulant used at a large scale for the control of A. terrestris population outbreaks. No decline of population was recorded at Chemin, where bromadiolone was not used for rodent control. Significant differences among ELISA OD distributions in fox faeces were recorded for the five winters under study at Le Souillot √∞P ¬º 0:0004√û. The median of ELISA OD distribution was 0.209 and 0.207 before the population decline (winter 1995 and 1996, respectively), significantly increased to 0.306 just after the decline (winter 1997), and then significantly decreased to 0.099 and 0.104 afterwards (winter 1998 and 1999, respectively). Therefore, the decrease in infection level occurred during winter 1998, 1 year after the population decline, when the intermediate host biomass in the field was at its highest.

The cestode is distributed on Hokkaido, a northern island of Japan, and the increasing prevalence of E. multilocularis in red foxes, Vulpes vulpes schrencki, serving as a definitive host, has become a considerable concern (1). Recently, echinococcosis was found in pigs in Aomori, in the northern part of mainland Japan (2). The source of infection of those pigs has not yet been identi- fied, although an intensive epidemiological survey of wild animals in Aomori was carried out (3,4). Many motor vehicles commute between Hokkaido and Aomori by ferryboat, and cars carrying soil contaminated with E. multilocularis eggs could be a possible vector of infection (5). Though various techniques have been developed to detect ascarid eggs in soil (6,7), no appropriate methods for detecting taeniid eggs in soil are available. In the experiments presented herein, we applied the centrifugal flotation technique to the detection of Echinococcus eggs in sandy soil. Two kilograms of sandy soil that had been mixed with 10,000 non-infective eggs of E. multilocularis preserved in 70% ethanol since 1969 were put in a bucket, then 3 liters of water or water containing 0.05% Tween-80 was added. The mixture was stirred vigorously and sieved through a 100-Œºm mesh. The solution was stirred again and the heavy particles were allowed to settle for 10-15 sec. Immediately, 300 ml, (i.e., 1/10) of the supernatant fraction was equally divided into six 50-ml centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the sediment was resuspended in 10 ml of a sucrose solution (specific gravity 1.27) in a 10-ml tube and centrifuged again at 1,000 g for 15 min. Sucrose solution was gently added until the solution reached the top of the tube, and a coverslip was placed on top. The coverslips were examined 2 h later. Eggs could be detected in all the samples. The numbers of eggs detected in the soil samples suspended in 0.05% Tween-80 solution were significantly higher than those detected in the samples suspended in water (i.e., 113 ¬± 15.3 and 10 ¬± 5.7, respectively (t test, P = 0.0004, n = 3)). Thus, we adopted the centrifugal flotation method using 0.05% Tween-80, water, and sucrose solution with specific gravity of 1.27. The survey for detecting E. multilocularis eggs in the soil left in the ferryboats was carried out using ferries on two routes, between Hakodate and Aomori, and between Muroran and Aomori (Hakodate and Muroran are in Hokkaido) from July to September, September to October, October to December of 2000, and in April of 2001. Samples were collected from the car deck of the ferryboats in the Aomori port. Total samples from Muroran and Hakodate ferry routes weighed 36 and 36 kg, respectively. The soil was frozen at -80¬∞C for at least 2 weeks to inactivate the eggs infectivity. With the above technique, no helminth eggs were detected, though Isospora oocysts, mites, and eggs of mites were found. The foxes in Hokkaido are heavily infected with E. multilocularis; the maximum number of worms recorded from a fox was 34,000 (1). An average of 300 eggs per gravid segment was counted in E. multilocularis from a fox from this region (8). If a fox heavily infected with E. multilocularis is run over by a car, a huge number of eggs will burst into the environment from the viscera, and that car and subsequent cars passing over the fox could be contaminated with the eggs. In fact, infected foxes are frequent victims of traffic accidents in Hokkaido (5). Although Echinococcus eggs were not detected from the ferry soil investigated in the present survey, surveillance of the transmission of E. multilocularis eggs from Hokkaido to Honshu by motor vehicle on ferries should be monitored to prevent the spread of E. multilocularis from Hokkaido to mainland Japan.",not-needed,English,environmental,,,,,,NA,,Snowballing

Four microsatellite targets (EmsJ, EmsK, and EmsB, which were designed in our laboratory, and NAK1, selected from the literature) were tested on a panel of 76 E. multilocularis samples (larval and adult stages) obtained from Alaska, Canada, Europe, and Asia.

The EmsB target, a tandem repeated multilocus microsatellite, found 17 alleles showing a complex pattern. Hierarchical clustering analyses were performed with the EmsB findings, and 29 genotypes were identified. Due to its higher genetic polymorphism, EmsB exhibited a higher discriminatory power than the other targets.

Between the years 1987 and 2000, antigens targeted on 66, 55 and 30-35 kDa bands were routinely used in the WB step of AE diagnosis. However, since 2001 diagnosis has been dependent on three smaller molecular weight antigens (26-28, 18 and 7-8 kDa). Due to its higher sensitivity, this improved WB approach has been used as a confirmation step in the screening process and also for the testing of suspected AE cases in hospital outpatients. Using the improved WB technique, a total of 1745 serum samples were examined in 2001-2006 with 81 patients detected and registered with AE. Interestingly, sera from 76 of the 81 diagnosed AE patients (93.8%) demonstrated reactivity with all three antigens. However, sera from the remaining five patients (6.2%) demonstrated no reactivity with the 18 kDa antigen, even though they exhibited clearly detectable levels of reactivity with the 26-28 and 7-8 kDa bands. These results suggest that medical practitioners need to pay particular attention to the specific reactions to some different diagnostic antigens to minimize the risk of misdiagnosing AE patients.

In this study, the prevalence of taeniid infections in potential intermediate hosts was evaluated using both morphological diagnosis and a newly described multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for species determination. Small mammals (N=√´_719) were trapped in three different types of habitats in north-east Zealand, Denmark. The sensitivity of the multiplex PCR (90.5%) exceeded that of morphological examination (57.9%) for identifying 95 taeniid infections.

The prevalence of taeniid infections showed a significant difference according to habitat type, potentially identifying a 'sylvatic' transmission and an 'urban' transmission, with marked variation among different taeniid species. Versteria mustelae and T. polyacantha were more prevalent in rural forests, while infections with H. taeniaeformis were dominant in urban parks/forests and in residential and farm gardens.

When the small intestines of another 162 infected foxes were examined by IST and the results recorded separately for the anterior, middle and posterior third of the small intestine, a strong preference of E. multilocularis for the posterior third was observed.

Fecal samples collected from 430 plateau pikas were examined by the modified McMaster technique, which revealed that 83% of the samples contained eggs from two or more helminth species. Mean fecal egg counts were generally moderate and showed the same trend irrespective of the age or sex of the pikas.

We analyzed 57 coyote carcasses that were collected between October 2010 and March 2011 in the metropolitan area of Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Before analyses, intestines and feces were frozen at -80 C for 72 hr to inactivate Echinococcus eggs, protecting operators from potential exposure. Five species of helminths were found by postmortem examination, including Toxascaris leonina, Uncinaria stenocephala, Ancylostoma caninum, Taenia sp., and Echinococcus multilocularis. Sensitivity of fecal flotation was high (0.84) for detection of T. leonina but low for Taenia sp. (0.27), E. multilocularis (0.46), and U. stenocephala (0.00). Good kappa agreement between techniques was observed only for T. leonina (0.64), for which we detected also a significant correlation between adult female parasite intensity and fecal egg counts (R(s)=0.53, P=0.01). Differences in sensitivity may be related to parasite characteristics that affect recovery of eggs on flotation.

This study was designed to evaluate the carriage of the larval form of E. multilocularis and other cestodes in a musk rat (Ondatra zibethicus) population trapped along the Ourthe River (southeastern Belgium). Six hundred fifty-seven musk rats were necropsied, and the larval cestodes of the abdominal and pleural cavities were identified. For E. multilocularis, the fertility of the cysts was verified in 58 liver samples. The following species were found: Taenia taeniaeformis (65.8%), Taenia martis (22.2%), E. multilocularis (22.1%), Taenia polyacantha (2.6%), and Taenia crassiceps (0.9%). Results were analyzed according to the site of capture (upper, middle, and lower Ourthe). There was a highly significant relationship between the carriage of E. multilocularis and the site of capture (the prevalence being higher in the upper part of the river). This difference could be due to different geoclimatic conditions. All but one hepatic lesion were found to contain protoscoleces of E. multilocularis (98.8%). The musk rat is probably infected through the consumption of plant material contaminated by the fox's feces. The red fox can occasionally prey on musk rats, but the musk rat cadavers that are left on the river banks by the trappers are probably also consumed. This could favor the maintenance of E. multilocularis life cycle. In conclusion, the musk rat seems to be highly susceptible to E. multilocularis and in Belgium could play the role of reservoir; when present this species could represent an inexpensive and sensitive bioindicator for the study and monitoring of the zoonosis.",Yes,English,,,,,,,NA,,SystematicSearch

In August, 1991, 65 (5%) of 1312 people residing in three rural communes of Zhang County, Gansu Province, China were diagnosed as having hepatic AE after mass ultrasound scanning with serological back-up. This represents one of the highest prevalence rates of AE ever recorded. It is also the first time that mass ultrasound scanning and serology have been used together in an AE endemic region.

increase of prevalence rate in foxes in Bade-W0rtemberg (Germany) and Franche-Comt6 (France),
traditionally endemic, also supports this new trend. Urban foxes and the spreading of infected foxes
to cities may also be the cause of the extension to urban and suburban areas of a disease which was
believed to be limited to rural areas. The setting up of an epidemio-surveillance system for fox (dog,
cat) populations is currently in progress. It will be grounded on coprotests (ELISA, PCR) for the detection of E. mu/ti/ocularis material in definitive hosts' faeces and on sampling based on the multiscale
analysis of the characteristics of landscapes favourable to transmission. A register of human cases
has been established at the European level (WHO Collaborative Centre of the University of FrancheComt6 and Universities of UIm and Hohenheim). Unfortunately, the evolution of the parasite distribution and of the risks of exposure in France is unrecognised. Progress in surveillance and prevention

Prospective collection of human cases in some areas and mass screenings using ultrasound imaging and confirmation with serological techniques have markedly improved our knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease in humans during the past two decades. Transmission occurs when eggs of the tapeworm, excreted by the final hosts (usually foxes but also dogs, wolves and cats), are ingested accidentally by humans or during normal feeding by a variety of rodents and small lagomorphs. However, the species of host animals differ according to regional changes in mammalian fauna. This review mostly focuses on epidemiology of alveolar echinococcosis in those parts of the world where new and more accurate epidemiological data are now available, i.e. China and Europe, as well as on new epidemiological trends that can be suspected from recent case reports and/or from recent changes in animal epidemiology of E. multilocularis infection. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is a newly recognized focus on AE in Asia. Human AE cases were firstly recognized in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Provinces at the end of 1950s and infected animals were first reported from Ningxia in central China and northeast of Inner Mongolia in the 1980s. E. multilocularis (and human cases of AE) appears to occur in three areas: (1) Northeastern China (northeast focus): including Inner Mongolia Autonomous region and Heliongjiang Province (2) Central China (central focus): including Gansu Province, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Sichuan Province, Qinghai Province and Tibet Autonomous Region and (3) Northwestern China: including Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, bordered with Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The highest prevalence of the disease, up to 15 per cent of the population in some villages, is reached in China. In Europe, data from the European Echinococcosis Registry (EurEchinoReg: 1982-2000) show 53 autochthonous cases of AE in Austria, 3 in Belgium, 235 in France, 126 in Germany, 1 in Greece, and 112 in Switzerland, and 15 'imported' cases, especially from central Asia; 14 cases were collected in Poland, a country not previously considered endemic for AE. Improved diagnostic technology, as well as a real increase in the infection rate and an extension to new areas, can explain that more than 500 cases have been reported for these 2 decades while less than 900 cases were published for the previous 7 decades. New epidemiological trends are related to an unprecedented increase in the fox population in Europe, to the unexpected development of urban foxes in Japan and in Europe, and to changes in the environmental situation in many countries worldwide due to climatic or anthropic factors which might influence the host-predator relationship in the animal reservoir and/or the behavioural characteristics of the populations in the endemic areas.",not-needed,English,not original data,,,,,,NA,review,SystematicSearch

We have tested this hypothesis in a number of endemic areas in China, notably south Gansu Province and the Tibetan region of western Sichuan Province. The fundamental landscape control is its effect at a regional scale on small mammal species assemblages (susceptible species are not ubiquitous) and, at a local scale, the spatial distributions of small mammal populations.

On the Tibetan plateau grassland management influences intermediate host species populations and the sheer size of the area could be a major contributing factor to sustaining transmission in the region. In Southern Gansu and Southern Ningxia the processes of deforestation have temporarily provided optimal habitat for key reservoir intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis, resulting in high transmission and human disease, however currently the parasite may be extinct locally. Faced with this pattern of potentially transient transmission in a diversity of communities the question of the dispersal potential of the parasite arises. The reforestation program currently active across much of Western China has the potential to give rise to a massive increase in habitat favourable to suitable intermediate hosts and emergence or re-emergence of the zoonosis alveolar echinococcosis in many areas. This potential epidemic could be mitigated by both natural and human induced parasite dispersal mechanisms including fox migration and the sale of infected dogs originating from stable endemic foci on the Tibetan plateau.

The distribution of the worm burden among foxes obtained using the model agreed with dissection data. The simulation indicates that a careful choice of season is necessary for an effective distribution of Praziquantel-containing bait.

Recent studies have shown that in central Europe E. multilocularis occurs further north, south and east than previously anticipated. This parasite is endemic in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The prevalence rates of E. multilocularis in foxes are alarmingly high in some areas with average rates > 40%. Infection rates in dogs and cats are much lower. In recent years accidental infections with the metacestode stage of E. multilocularis have been observed in various animal species (dog, domestic pig, wild boar, nutria and monkeys) and in humans.

For monitoring of the infection in final host populations new techniques are now available, notably the coproantigen ELISA and for selected cases also egg detection by the Polymerase Chain Reaction. E. granulosus has an uneven geographical distribution in Europe with very low prevalence rates in some of the northern and central European countries, with medium endemicity in others and high endemicity in areas of southern and eastern Europe. Cystic echinococcosis in humans is still a significant public health problem, predominantly in the Mediterranean area. Up to now five strains of E. granulosus have been identified in central Europe which differ in their life cycles as well as in morphological, biochemical, genetic and some other features. Several molecular techniques are now available which allow the identification of Echinococcus species and certain strains using genetic markers.

Mass screening ultrasound surveys can detect pre-symptomatic AE, but targeting areas identified from hospital records is inefficient regarding AE. Prediction of undetected or emerging hotspots would increase detection rates. Voles and lemmings of the subfamily Arvicolinae are important intermediate hosts in sylvatic transmission systems. Their populations reach high densities in productive grasslands where food and cover are abundant. Habitat availability is thought to affect arvicoline population dynamic patterns and definitive host-intermediate host interactions. Arvicoline habitat correlates with AE prevalence in Western Europe and southern Gansu Province, China. Methods and findings: Xiji County Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region borders southern Gansu. The aims of this study were to map AE prevalence across Xiji and test arvicoline habitat as a predictor. Land cover was mapped using remotely sensed (Landsat) imagery. Infection status of 3205 individuals screened in 2002-2003 was related using generalised additive mixed models to covariates: gender; farming; ethnicity; dog ownership; water source; and areal cover of mountain pasture and lowland pasture. A Markov random field modelled additional spatial variation and uncertainty. Mountain pasture and lowland pasture were associated with below and above average AE prevalence	 respectively. Conclusions: Low values of the normalised difference vegetation index indicated sub-optimality of lowland pasture for grassland arvicolines. Unlike other known endemic areas grassland arvicolines probably did not provide the principal reservoir for Echinococcus multilocularis in Xiji. This result is consistent with recent small mammal surveys reporting low arvicoline densities and high densities of hamsters, pikas and jerboas, all suitable intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis in reforested lowland pasture. The risk of re-emergence is discussed. We recommend extending monitoring to: southern Haiyuan County where predicted prevalence was high; southern Xiji County where prediction uncertainty was high; and monitoring small mammal community dynamics and the infection status of dogs.""",Yes,English,,human,,,,,NA,,Snowballing

in view of generating a fine-tuned map of parasite variants occurring in Europe. This approach may serve as a model to
study the parasite at a worldwide level.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The genetic diversity of E. multilocularis was assessed based upon the tandemly repeated
microsatellite marker EmsB in association with matching fox host geographical positions. Our study demonstrated a higher
genetic diversity in the endemic areas north of the Alps when compared to other areas.
Conclusions/Significance: The study of the spatial distribution of E. multilocularis in Europe, based on 32 genetic clusters,
suggests that Europe can be considered as a unique global focus of E. multilocularis, which can be schematically drawn as a
central core located in Switzerland and Jura Swabe flanked by neighbouring regions where the parasite exhibits a lower

The post 20 years have been marked by: Epidemiologic changes: discovery of an endemic area in China, the largest in the world; extension of the European endemic range to the east and north; extension of the French endemic range to the west and south; and the settlement of contaminated foxes in urban centers, which will modify the populations at risk over time.

Although both trials reduced prevalence considerably, they failed to eradicate the parasite in the study region. Following the control trial in northern Germany, prevalence recovered unexpectedly and rapidly, reaching pre-control levels five quarters (15 months) after the end of control. To understand the internal dynamics of the parasite–host system’s reaction to control, we developed a spatially explicit simulation model, Echi. The simulation model incorporates the information available concerning fox tapeworm population dynamics.Using epidemiological parameters to adjust pre-control prevalence, the model predicts the temporal evolution of the prevalence of E. multilocularis in controlled foxes without departing from the range of uncertainty of the field data. However, the model does not predict the rapid pre-control recovery observed in the field trial.The deviation of the model’s prediction from field data indicates the involvement of processes not yet taken into account. We modified the model step by step to mimic processes with the potential to cause the rapid post-control recovery of the prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes.Neither the longevity of tapeworm eggs nor the migratory behaviour of foxes showed any influence on the post-control reaction of the parasite–host system. However, landscape structures leading to a heterogeneous distribution of infected foxes have the potential to alter the system’s reaction to control. If infected foxes are concentrated in multiple clusters in the landscape, the model prediction tallied with the range of uncertainty of the field data. Such spatial distribution of infected foxes may be caused by differential abiotic conditions influencing the survival of tapeworm eggs.The model was found to comply best with field data if the foxes acquire partial immunity by being exposed to the fox tapeworm.Both hypotheses explaining the rapid post-control recovery of the prevalence of E. multilocularis observed in the fox population were supported by field data.Both hypotheses have far-reaching consequences for future control trials. The spatial aggregation of infected foxes would enable control efforts to be concentrated on these highly infected areas.

Although the adult parasite, which inhabits the intestine of various carnivore species is not pathogenic, the larval or metacestode stages can be highlypathogenic, causing economic losses to livestock and various forms of echinococcosis in humans, some of which have a high fatalityrate. There is growing evidence that there are at least 5 species ofEchinococcus rather than the generallyaccepted 4 species. Within these species there are a number of genotypes or strains. This canhave implications for surveillance and control. In some wealthycountries, cystic echinococcosis caused by Echinococcus granulosushas been successfullycontrolled or indeed eradicated. However, in most parts of the world it remains a serious threat to humanhealth. In the former Soviet Union, the disease has rapidlyincreased in incidence after the end of communist administration. Humanalveolar echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is more sporadic. However, in some Chinese communities there is adisturbinglyhigh human prevalence and in Europe there has been an increase in the detection rate of E. multilocularis in animals inthe last 10 years. Echinococcosis can present diagnostic challenges, particularly in the definitive host in areas of low endemicity.Much of the recent work relating to the use of coproantigen and PCR to overcome these difficulties is summarized. New ideas forcontrolling the parasite are becoming available and these include both the use of vaccination and the application of mathematicalmodels to determine the most cost effective means of control.

This parasite needs two hosts to complete its life cycle; the gray-sided vole as its intermediate host and the red fox as its final host. We found that: (1) Infection rates in foxes depended on the current-year abundance of voles in all three study areas, particularly in Abashiri. (2) In addition to this direct density-dependence, delayed density-dependence between the infection rate and the prior-year abundance of voles was detected in Nemuro and in Kushiro. (3) The regional differences in density-dependence pattern were related to regional differences in the winter food habits of red foxes: in Abashiri the proportion of voles in the fox's diet greatly decreases in winter, while the proportion remains high in winter in Nemuro and in Kushiro, probably because of shallower snowpack. These results suggest that infection rates in foxes in Abashiri were less influenced by the prior-year prevalence, since the infection cycle might be interrupted in winter, when voles became less important in fox's diet. In contrast, the state of the prevalence may carry over from year to year in Nemuro and in Kushiro, because red foxes continue to eat a considerable amount of voles throughout year. The regionally contrasted results for the relationship between infection rate in foxes and vole abundance were parallel to the regional difference in fluctuation pattern of vole populations, which are highly variable in Abashiri area, but less variable in Kushiro-Nemuro area. Drastic change in vole populations appears to affect the host-parasite system. ",Yes,English,,,,,"GMPD_388, GMPD_389",GMPD_387,NA,,Snowballing

Prevention of 9-50% of human alveolar echinococcosis-associated losses is suggested based on stochastic models for the current epidemiologic situation.

An evaluation of the cost/benefit relationship of this screening, followed by therapeutic management of patients, was made and compared with the actual cost of the follow-up and treatment of the disease in symptomatic cases in this endemic area. Antibody reactions to Em2 and/or Emc made possible the detection of eight asymptomatic clinical cases (seroprevalence averaging 1/1,000), with typical lesions of active AE revealed by abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography. All were seropositive using the Emc ELISA but two were seronegative using the Em2 ELISA. In five additional seropositive cases, the radiologic investigations revealed small calcified lesions similar to the lesions of abortive AE previously found in Alaska. The cost of this serologic screening program per screened subject and per diagnosed case averaged 50.00 French Francs (FF) (U.S. $8.60) and 60,000.00 FF (U.S. $10,909.00), respectively.

This survey indicates a high prevalence of AE in the target area; it confirms the long latency period of the larval growth in human AE and shows that abortive AE is present in Europe. The use of both the Emc and Em2 ELISAs seems to be better than using the Em2 ELISA alone.

Thirty-eight red foxes (56. 7%) and 3 raccoon dogs (23.1%) were found to be infected with E. multilocularis. The total biomass of E. multilocularis in all infected red foxes and raccoon dogs were 2,817,000 and 1,515 worms, respectively. Nine of the infected red foxes harboring more than 100,000 worms accounted for 90.6% of the total biomass. No significant differences in the prevalence were observed between male and female, and juvenile and adult. However, the worm burden was higher in juvenile than in adult foxes. In one of the infected raccoon dogs, mature worms and eggs of E. multilocularis were found in the intestine and fecal sample, respectively.

(type No. 2) with spherical uterus at segment top. The metacestode development in rodents also differed among those 3 parasites. In the case of E. multilocularis (type No. 3), many germinal cells grew on the inner surface of early cysts, most of which metastasized into host tissue to form brood vesicles or from the germinal cell layer on the inner surface of the vesicle wall. Cells also had an appearance of proliferating by means of alveolar buds from alveolar tissue that developed outward to form new alveolar foci. In Echinococcus cf. sibiricensis (type No. 1), the formation of alveolar vesicles was due to the metastasizing of germinal tissue into host tissue; protoscoleces grew in the center of alveolar vesicles. In type No. 2 (Echinococcus sp.), the formation of the alveolar vesicle was by multiplication of germinal cell layers on the inner surface of alveolar cysts; protoscoleces grew from the germinal cell layer and mesh in the vesicles. On the basis of uterine structure and on differences in development of metacestodes in experimental rodents, we propose that the 3 types of Echinococcus represent 3 independent species: E. multilocularis, Echinococcus sibiricensis, and Echinococcus sp.

The improved sensitivity of the new methods (approximately 60% sensitivity with the new methods compared to 30% with the old) together with additional benefits such as closed tube detection and detectability of proglottid/adult stages in the material, resulted in the new system being adapted for use in the surveillance program as of 2012.

Raccoon dogs and red foxes harbored nine and 13 helminth species, respectively, many of which are potentially zoonotic. While all animals examined were Trichinella-free, a fox harbored 20 worms of E. multilocularis (0.3%). Parasites of raccoon dogs were mainly rodent-transmitted, while parasites of red foxes were mainly amphibian-transmitted, which may suggest less important role of raccoon dogs in the transmission of E. multilocularis. Differences in the prevalence, abundance and intestinal distribution of several parasite species were evident between the two host species. Flukes of Alaria alata in raccoon dogs were more prevalent and smaller in size than those recovered from foxes. In raccoon dogs, results of multivariate analysis showed that the abundances of Mesocestoides spp., A. alata and Cryptocotyle spp. were season-associated, while the abundance of Cryptocotyle spp. was associated also with the age of hosts. In foxes, regression parameters revealed increased incidence of Uncinaria stenocephala, A. alata and Pygidiopsis summa in adult foxes, increased incidence of Toxocara canis, A. alata and Mesorchis denticulatus in mainland compared to islands of Denmark, and increased incidence of T. canis and Cryptocotyle spp. in male foxes.

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the level of farmers' knowledge on CE transmission, focusing on the role of human to facilitate the persistence of this zoonosis in Sardinia after 14 years after the last campaign against CE. The other goal of the survey is to update on presence of Echinococcus granulosus in its definitive hosts through three ELISA coproantigen tests. An interview was carried out with 172 farmers. The questionnaire was designed to include possible factors associated with the transmission of Echinococcosis: ownership and number of dogs, the use of anthelmintic drugs against dog cestode, frequency of anthelmintic treatment in dogs, home slaughtering and offal disposal. Individual faecal samples were retrieved from 300 dogs, and after a preliminary macroscopic examination to discover adult worms and/or proglottids, was submitted to copromicroscopic examination. Coproantigens were then extracted according to the protocol described by Allan et al. (1992), and subsequently stored at -20√´√ßC until use. Faecal soluble antigens from E. granulosus were detected using three different ELISA coproantigen assays: (a) the commercially produced Chekit Echinotest (Bommeli, Bern, CH) based on polyclonal antibodies against adult excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens; (b) a sandwich ELISA that uses rabbit polyclonal antibodies against adult E/S antigens and biotinylated monoclonal antibody EmA9 produced against adult Echinococcus multilocularis somatic extract (Malgor et al., 1997); and (c) a sandwich assay that uses monoclonal antibody EgC3 produced by immunization with adult E. granulosus E/S products (Casaravilla et al., 2005).

However, compared to the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), less attention has been paid to the raccoon dog as a potentially important host for Echinococcus multilocularis, the infective agent of alveolar echinococcosis, which is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. We examined the small intestines of 249 Estonian raccoon dogs and found 1.6% of individuals to be infected with E. multilocularis. The relatively large difference between this prevalence and that found in sympatric red foxes (31.5%) sampled during the same time period might be due to differences in diet: red foxes consume significantly more arvicolid rodents - the main intermediate hosts of the parasite - especially during the coldest period of the year when raccoon dogs hibernate. Nonetheless, given the relatively high density of raccoon dogs, our results suggest that the species also represents an important definitive host species for E. multilocularis in Estonia. Compared with other countries in Europe where E. multilocularis-infected raccoon dogs have been recorded (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Germany, and Slovakia), the prevalence in Estonia is low. The longer hibernation period of raccoon dogs at higher latitudes may explain this pattern. Both mitochondrial and nuclear loci were analysed for Estonian isolates: based on EmsB microsatellite genotyping the Estonian isolates shared an identical genotype with E. multilocularis in northern Poland, suggesting a common history with this region. The data from more than a quarter of the mitochondrial genome (3558 bp) revealed two novel haplotypes specific to Estonia and placed them into the same haplogroup with isolates from other European regions.

The correlation between the number of detected specimens and the value of optical density of copro-ELISA test was found. When worm burdens were low (1-25 specimens) the sensitivity of the method was 31.3+/-8.64%, when worm burdens were >50 specimens, 81.8+/-0.66%, and with high worm burdens (>1000 specimens) the sensitivity reached 100+/-0.34%. E. multilocularis presence was detected using the nested PCR method from the eggs in the faecal samples with a 100% specificity. In epidemiological surveys of this zoonosis, it is of crucial importance to detect animals with a high level of infection, which are responsible for the bulk of environmental contamination. The advantage of copro-ELISA test lies in allowing the intravital diagnostics to be employed within the epidemiological survey of E. multilocularis occurrence in the protected and urban areas.",Yes,English,,,location size,"GMPD_374, GMPD_375",,,NA,,SystematicSearch

A study of the helminth fauna of foxes from Naryn Oblast in central Kyrgyzstan was undertaken to investigate the abundance of Echinococcus multilocularis in a district where a high prevalence of this parasite had previously been detected in dogs. A total of 151 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were investigated in a necropsy study. Of these 96 (64%) were infected with E. multilocularis with a mean abundance of 8669 parasites per fox. This indicates that red foxes are a major definitive host of E. multilocularis in this country. This also demonstrates that the abundance and prevalence of E. multilocularis in the natural definitive host are likely to be high in geographical regions where there is a concomitant high prevalence in alternative definitive hosts such as dogs. In addition Mesocestoides spp., Dipylidium caninum, Taenia spp., Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Capillaria and Acanthocephala spp. were found in 99 (66%), 50 (33%), 48 (32%), 46 (30%), 9 (6%), 34 (23%) and 2 (1%) of foxes, respectively. The prevalence but not the abundance of E. multilocularis decreased with age. The abundance of D. caninum also decreased with age. The frequency distribution of E. multilocularis and Mesocestoides spp. followed a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, whilst all other helminths had a negative binomial distribution. This demonstrates that the frequency distribution of positive counts and not just the frequency of zeros in the data set can determine if a zero-inflated or non-zero-inflated model is more appropriate.

There is, to date, no evidence of indigenous cases of E. multilocularis in Great Britain (GB) but in most of continental Europe the parasite is considered to be endemic and/or slowly spreading. All pet dogs entering the United Kingdom (UK) under the pet travel scheme (PETS) are therefore currently treated with an anthelmintic effective against Echinococcus spp. Surveillance of red foxes is required to demonstrate disease freedom and maintain this regulation to prevent further geographical spread of the parasite to free areas within the EU.

AE occurs in large areas of the northern hemisphere mostly with low country-wide prevalences, but high prevalences of up to 4% have been reported from small population groups in highly endemic foci, e.g. from China. AE includes many veterinary aspects which are the topic of this review. Recent studies have shown that E. multilocularis has a wider geographic range than previously anticipated. There is evidence for growing populations of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in some areas, for increasing invasion of cities by foxes and also for establishment of the parasite cycle in urban areas. These and other factors may lead to an increased infection risk for humans. Significant progress has been made in the development of sensitive and specific new techniques for the intra vitam and post mortem diagnosis of intestinal E. multilocularis infection in definitive hosts, notably the detection of coproantigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and of copro-DNA by PCR. Both tests can also be used for the identification of E. multilocularis in faecal samples collected in the environment. Recommendations are given for chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis of the intestinal infection in definitive hosts. In recent years, infections with the metacestode stage of E. multilocularis have not only been diagnosed in humans in several regions, including at least eight countries in central Europe, but also in animal species which do not play a role in the transmission cycle (wild and domestic pigs, dogs etc.).

The danger of human infection would thus increase for the areas investigated. The hypothesis that a greater occurrence of fox tapeworm is related to higher fox population densities due to the widespread vaccination against rabies is supported by the concurrence of these events. The comparison of the respective dangers to human health and life of rabies or Echinococcus multilocularis infection shows at least a 10 x higher occurrence of lethal cases of alveolar echinococcus infection as compared to human rabies infections when the incidence of this was most widespread among foxes.

A temperospatial analysis of compiled epidemiological data from 1996 to 2003 predicted a northwest spread of the cestode from Wallonia and the Netherlands towards Flanders and Brussels (Prev. Vet. Med. 2006, 76, 137-150). In 2007-2008, none of 187 examined foxes from the north tested positive (<2.8%, √Ø¬± = 0.01), compared to 1.7% in 1996-1999. This suggests that the parasite is not emerging in the examined area and the endemic region has not significantly extended northwest during the last decade. The possible reasons are discussed in the article, including the relatively low altitude, milder climate or low abundance of suitable intermediate hosts. The low prevalence in foxes and the generally low infection rate in humans imply that the risk for public health in Flanders and Brussels is limited anno 2007-2008.",not-needed,English,no E. multi detection,,,,,,NA,,SystematicSearch

Of the four cases reported to date, three have had no known history of travel outside the province. It is possible that this development is an indication of previously unrecognized environmental contamination with Echinococcus multilocularis eggs in some areas of the province. If so, there is the potential for an emerging threat to human health. This article describes a local public health department's investigation of the possible exposure to E.‚Äò_multilocularis of a number of individuals who had had contact with the latest of the four cases of canine AE, and summarizes a comprehensive decision process that can be used by public health departments to assist in the follow-up of such exposures.",Yes,English,,,,,EID_193,,NA,,Snowballing
