Reviews are a key method of synthesizing scientific topics and proposing future directions for the field. In natural sciences, systematic reviews are embraced as a method to comprehensively identify literature. These keyword-focused searches through library databases however frequently omit relevant literature. In this workshop, we explore complementary methods to discover relevant sources overlooked by systematic searches. We explore two literature lists from two species interaction case-studies: 1) the hosts of the fox tapeworm (*Echinococcus multilocularis*) and 2) the diet items of the ringtail (*Bassariscus astutus*). Using the bibliographies of these studies, we will explore and describe place-based, text mining, and person-based approaches.  

We hope exploring these case-studies can facilitate discussion about performing more inclusive literature reviews.
